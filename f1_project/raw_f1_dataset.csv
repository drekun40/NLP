For me, if it's more than three or four laps, like more than three laps, four laps racing, then the ins are going to be better because I don't think they're going to let us race until it's condition where the inter is actually probably stronger. So I think the inter is better, but if it's like three or three laps, then the way it's maybe. Copy that. It's just because we're thinking about warm up.
