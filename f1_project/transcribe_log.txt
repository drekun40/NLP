[285/6155] ALO: You can put a red flag before. Yeah, copy right there. Maybe because we don't complete a lap, we go back to the same positions, it happens in Silverstone. Yes, we're looking at that mate, we're on that, we're already on that. Just get the car back. Do you think this damage? No, it's okay, the car is okay. Copy mate, okay. Check this immediately.

[288/6155] HUL: Okay, they just published a restart order and we're back in 18. I don't understand why, but that's where we are so we'll be reshuffling the cars. Who is in front of Norris? You told me. Yeah, I'm here.
[289/6155] BOT: We are to driver. As it is the last lap, it's going to be a lap behind the safety car to finish the race. How come I go back to 12? This was the last point, the timing was established. Yeah, but there's some people go off, you know, they should have been able to get back.
[290/6155] SAI: No, it cannot be Ricky. Do I deserve to be out of the points? No. It's unacceptable. Tell them. It is unacceptable. They need to wait until the race is finished and discuss with me. No, please, please, please, please, please, please, to wait and discuss with me. They clearly, the penalty is not deserved. It's too severe.
[291/6155] VER: OK, Max. So, the plan is safety car will enter the pit lane at the end of this lap. You will then take the checkered flag. The rolling starts high E. Just take the checkered flag. There is no overtaking until the line.

[295/6155] SAI: Please guys, do something, please. I cannot still believe it. We have been three and before and they want to put me out of the points for that. For a one-lap incident. So I'm afraid. I cannot believe they do this to me. It's clear Carlos, it's clear. Let's finish that price and we'll discuss here. But let me at least discuss with the stewards in the stewards room. Of course, we'll go and see them just after you get out of the car.
[296/6155] PIA: We were within five seconds of science, so asking that should be P8 once that penalty is applied well done buddy. Points, homegrown pre, about weekend. Cool, thanks everyone, first points. Nice to do it at home, thank you.

King of Baku, back up. Great recovery Jacko. P5 fastest lap. So for the back of the grid that's decent points from where you started. Well done mate. Yeah, good job guys. Let's keep it up. You are also dribbled the day I believe. That doesn't get us any points though. Sadly not.

[303/6155] PER: Everyone ready? Ready to test it out.
[304/6155] RUS: Have we got all three compounds of tire on the grid? Negative, we can chat when you get out of the car there.
[305/6155] RUS: I'd like to consider a change of the start tire, you know which direction that'll probably be.
[306/6155] ALB: Coffee was good, no real issues so. Oh yeah, I'm happy. Copy that.
[307/6155] RUS: For the original lap, the pedal was a bit spongy, a little bit long, but the deceleration of the bike was really quite good, it was grabbing well. It's rare that you have those two together.
[308/6155] HAM: It's a little bit soft. Okay. It's like passive. Yeah, we can.
[309/6155] HAM: So we've got Norris P10 on the soft tyre, Bottas P15 also on the soft, everyone else on medium. Looks like both for our ears are on the new medium, everyone else on used.
[310/6155] VER: He is happy.
[311/6155] VER: All the maps, these eyes, I've got nothing to lose, just remember that. No wait, he told me that's how you got the position before it. It's been reported. I can also pass like that if I keep coming into the site.
[312/6155] NOR: Yeah, I mean there's a tie in the middle of the track so pretty bad in my opinion. It's better just to stop in for now. I just only got a puncture on the street circuit so I'd rather they clear the debris away. There's too much debris. Yeah, great. A puncture is our concern too.
[313/6155] SAI: I think I went through some dirty Check from right and rear right The stood The moment they are fine pressures while we are checking

[315/6155] VER: We have picked up some floor damage just wait it for the balance ships. How? How do you think? Did he really drive into the side of the... I don't understand how he can keep the position and he's damaging my car. Smiling ridiculous.
[316/6155] HAM: Yeah, debris has gone. It's clear. Okay, thanks a lot.
[317/6155] HAM: Yeah, the tapery is gone. It's clear. Okay, thanks for that.

[344/6155] OCO: Oh yeah, I'm in a folding now. So.
[345/6155] RUS: So a couple of the medium runners now complaining about the rear. We're just keeping an eye on your rear surfaces.
[346/6155] HUL: I don't know if the rear is completely gone, but no real grip left. Okay, copy that. We see it. Yep, it's a bad raining line. Understood. You can see really bad raining on both sides. Okay, at this stage then you just have to push through it unfortunately. Both tests behind on soft, so he's struggling.
[347/6155] PIA: Okay, two laps to go, let's see if there's anything left in the tire to attack him.

[354/6155] ALO: Okay, let's check it flat. Well done. Check the flat. P6. Good job mate. We'll review the starts. Good points. Yeah, the store. I mean, I wasn't the inside. If I lived off, it gets away with it. If I don't live off, we will crash both into the wall. So, I mean, so yeah, if you take my own board, you know, say what happens. If I don't live off, for sure, the penalty will be applied.
[355/6155] PIA: I think given everything else that's been going on this weekend that's pretty impressive. Thanks, not too bad. I struggled a bit at the end with tyres. Thanks guys.
[356/6155] DEV: I just called him and he turned into 170 or 80. Yeah, not sure why he's turned the racing line when he's boxing. But yeah, I thought that's a copy.

[359/6155] STR: Okay, Lance, that's checkered flag, that's P8. It's a very hard and point. Well done, couple of great overtakes there, well done. Yeah, really well managed race. That was catching Hamilton at the end as well. So really strong race, P6 for Fernando. Yeah, good points.

Just good to try, but yeah, obviously it's hard. Good to take it. Yeah, we have a good chance tomorrow, I think the car feels good to fight. So, just got some fun tomorrow.
[361/6155] ZHO: Solid race, that's the end, Joe. We finished P12. Yeah, good recover. Very difficult up one with the tires, man. But pace was quite strong. It is a shame that the IS was out out of reach. But yeah, the car felt pretty decent so far. That was a good race, a lot of other. Got me to help. That's good.
[362/6155] MAG: Okay, check it flat, well done mate, here 11. Excellent place though, that's the big takeaway, really good place. Yeah, so I couldn't make up more positions, but I agree, please look decent, so let's try it now. Do a bit more tomorrow.

[402/6155] ALB: and in sector 2 let me know if you're not happy doing that. This is too much red.
[403/6155] ZHO: We're sliding a lot, guys!
[404/6155] ALO: The lands, my grandparents, suggest him as I am now. I think it's a good help. Yeah, copy, friend, copy, I will understand.
[405/6155] HAM: Now the light tonight is great thing over, I can't see what time's it. Currently no way of switching that off without losing information.
[406/6155] ZHO: Yeah, how about a little bit of boxing with sliding, so they say, what we can do. To all drivers out complaining, just keep focus, stay calm, still in long race. A lot of things can happen.
[407/6155] TSU: To begin our test, we need to teach all 4 doctors in-game evil skills, Devil's
[408/6155] NOR: No-so-lat and the speed business ñ
[409/6155] NOR: And I know I completely understand. Remember Hulk struggled yesterday, this will come naturally on him. The key thing is Plan B.

[411/6155] RUS: Yeah a
[412/6155] GAS: So nobody has reacted to a stopping.
[413/6155] HUL: Well, I'm struck like...
[414/6155] NOR: I land on the Ocon and Hulk can't stay out forever so now's the time just to build some margin with these tires once we're released that'll be the time.
[415/6155] HUL: Hit will end 15, check front drive, pressure. Pressure is okay, all okay.
[416/6155] SAI: What do you think between planet E. Plan C? Are you still at P. Plan E? Yes, the profit is...
[417/6155] VER: Just give us heads up with what you're struggling with Max. The balance is in the different angle for your kick is not good. Okay, well have a look.

[428/6155] NOR: So Lanna, this is just a bit of a question ahead. A safety car now would be very bad timing. We'd either stay out on our hard for nights, or you'd pit from medium, be 11th, and on the same tire as the cars ahead. We're after your thoughts. Probably at mid-medium.
[429/6155] ALO: Last lap you were 410s quick and a little bit. 1.6 seconds, quick and a science use is getting hassle from Hamilton.
[430/6155] HAM: I'm going to get my power to get me at some stage. Okay, we'll have a look.

[432/6155] HUL: Here's our deck in a bit now. Copy that, we see it. I guess waiting for a seat. Yeah, still worth going as long as we can.
[433/6155] HUL: I think we need to pit the tires at a step. Just hang in there, just try to stay out. The only chances if we get some kind of safety car are red.

What a job. And this one goes to Tivo and his wife. He's still a big part of our team. Yes, right. Well done. BAMOS! Awesome stuff.
[439/6155] VER: I'm not sure Max. Yeah I'm not glad you've resolved that. Yeah well done Max. Check I got a little lucky with the safety car there but it's a long long season very very good points today so great team resolve well done. Yeah it is what it is.

I haven't seen many of you a lot this weekend but I've certainly appreciated it. Yeah, big shout out to the dog as well, thanks.
[443/6155] MAG: Wow, that was a first straight race, but you did your best. Sorry, we could get past that car in front, you know, just too quick on the straights. Yeah, well, as you never got off, sorry about that, man. Now where is mate? Everybody was trying to do their best, so there we go. There's always the next time that it's next weekend. Yeah.
[444/6155] HUL: Okay, checkered flag, Nico, checkered flag. Pretty good run there, Nico on that hard just didn't get the luck that we needed but there's really a good very long run there.
[445/6155] BOT: Obviously a difficult race for us. Long one. Yep, yeah, sure about the... Turn two, contact to the McLaren foot. After that was so good, we were there in safety car. But yeah. Try again next week. Yep, exactly. Just one week till next race.
[446/6155] OCO: 
[447/6155] ALO: Okay, man, let's check a flag. Well done. Well, my guys, not an easy weekend, but we still deliver what the people have to take from us. Top job today, guys.
[448/6155] RUS: 
[449/6155] HAM: Nice work Lewis, that's P6 mate, that's a great drive, I think had over a little bit with the safety car but really good recovery and they're a great job on that final stint, made it work. That's more like it last. No there is always one in but let's keep pushing guys, we're going in the right direction, we've got an advantageality, let's keep pushing.
[450/6155] SAI: Good job for that fight, first struggling for the pace as we know, so we need to look into it. Can I go jump there? Yeah. Let's have a good look into it. That means limitation, but sorry for being so slow all weekend. Let's have a look at it.
[451/6155] NOR: What on that's P9 P9. Yeah, good job. I feel pretty terrible, but this week I do today. So well. Yeah. Good job. Yeah, agreed. Nice job. Patience game. I know what we're going to talk about in the debrief. But what on?
[452/6155] RUS: Okay nice work P8 fastest lap there at the end. Yeah now good under. We've got a big corner up, I've been under the turn one and then notice a scrappy lamp one. After that safety car, think P5 is possible. Okay, we get to do it all again next week.

[777/6155] TSU: Here we need to find some paces mainly underbreking. Let's do your best I know it's difficult. I know but this brake sucks! Offset 5, build it up underbreking. You can do it. I tried to crush me once.
[778/6155] GAS: So, I must be careful with 10-11 at the spot, please.
[779/6155] GAS: Ok, next we've got three warnings now for turn 10 and 11 so be careful there please.

[780/6155] RUS: Let's take it right upstairs.
[781/6155] PER: 
[782/6155] NOR: Yeah, like people are racing against me. I know, I know. The car you're racing is science 48 seconds. Ah, sick.
[783/6155] TSU: Enough baked Thank you so much
[784/6155] ALO: The most damage is done after the tunnel breaking for 10 and the last 2 corners. That's where you do the most damage to the torts.
[785/6155] ALB: Synod is struggling on brakes.
[786/6155] VER: Do you see anything other than an inter? These next 9 laps? No, no. I'm just going to sit. Thank you.
[787/6155] VER: I'll clip them all a little bit with the right, we have to check questions. Okay, we'll have a look.
[788/6155] NOR: I suggest red A7, red A7, you're one of the quickest cars out there.
[789/6155] ALO: So from here we really think the best place to save some tyre, temp is 13, 14 and exit of the last corner traction.
[790/6155] HAM: I'm struggling for goodness it is mate.
[791/6155] ZHO: Are we raising the wind in the head or not?
[792/6155] NOR: 
[793/6155] ALB: What are these brake changes? You're changing the way the car's feeling every single time.
[794/6155] RUS: The car does it feel right after that, so just want to bring home, alright? Yeah, AFM, you did a really good job, you got three laps remaining.
[795/6155] VER: I've done it again, but well done mate. Very lovely, that was a real monocle. It was quite difficult there on the wet, but quite enjoyable as well. Thank you guys, that was a really well executed race, I think. Yeah, well done mate, that is a brilliant performance. I mean, it's nearly two hours long and you've covered all the conditions. Well done was a fantastic drive. Yeah, that was a long one for sure.
[796/6155] PER: I'd like check out that was a tough weekend for this weekend so put it behind you next week Barcelona.
[797/6155] PER: What the what the weekend guys sorry it was all my fault
[798/6155] VER: We are catching also the guys in front. Okay. Two laps remaining.
[799/6155] RUS: Okay, so that's P5. Good, consider where we started. Shame about the trip. Sorry guys. I don't have that podium. Some maybe. It looked quite tricky out there. Tricky for everyone. Watch. Nevertheless, well done. You finished P5. You started P8. It was a horrible race. So, right, right, cold, straight to GY's and that was, that's good. Good. Yeah, thanks, editor. On the next week.
[800/6155] HAM: Let's go! Great job guys! That was a tough race. Super grateful for the hard work. Everyone's putting in the greeners upgrade. Let's keep pushing. We need more. I don't know if you know that, but let's keep pushing. I believe in you guys. Thank you mate. Yeah, we believe in you too. Yeah, Louis has finally run down. And as you say, the team has done a brilliant job. The mechanics and strategy team today, the right course at the right time. So, good teamwork. Yes sir.
[801/6155] SAI: Yes, sorry guys, we could have gone there. That was a small mistake, but it was very tricky out there.
[802/6155] DEV: So obviously first things, this middle part of the stands, we really have to understand what's up on there. And then we picked up a very good place. So we'll review that. And otherwise, you should be pleased. Clean weekend, you kept it all together. And a lot to look forward to. It was a clean weekend. A lot of work ahead of us. But a lot of positives this weekend. Where did we finish? It's 12. I think the fact that I pushed so hard on the Yastry at the beginning really hurt me. Because it's also closed to me and once it got behind me, he also lost a lot. So for sure we didn't manage this well enough. I didn't expect the mediums of so much. Okay, copy that, thank you. Yeah, we'll talk about it.
[803/6155] PIA: Nice race, that's a good job. Thanks guys, both of us in the points. Really good strategy, really good call.
[804/6155] TSU: Check reflect. Yeah, what we did in the dry condition was everything gone. Yeah, no social.
[805/6155] NOR: Yeah, good job everyone. Good little couple points. Best we could do today. The pace is good obviously. So yeah, let's keep pushing guys. Keep it up. Thank you very much.
[806/6155] ALB: Okay check a flag, check a flag. P14, P14. Lots of drama. Yeah, okay, I'll talk about it later but I mean, the most difficult thing to manage is the car just all the time. NARs? Yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of people going off during that work period. No managed to keep it going so well done. Appreciate it's difficult. Alex, you did well in the conditions of all that well done.
[807/6155] SAR: I think it was an epic race with a lot to learn with this last hit on the inter tricky condition. A lot to review, a lot to discuss, a lot learned today. Sorry guys, I was a disaster. Oh sorry. Again as usual, it was a discussion between the negative and the positive. Of course there was a mistake today, there was also some strong positive. Like the one I'm bringing home, you did well in the commissions how about today. It was just unfortunate that a puncture that really put you in a contention and everything. Good learning.
[808/6155] ZHO: Good way sure, P13 at the end, difficult conditions but good recovery from qualifying.
[809/6155] ALO: Yeah, that's a podium baby. Well done guys. Not an easy race. Well executed. Bravo. Well done mate. Well done. P2. We're getting an x race. Hey, well done. Yes, yes, yes. I'm very happy mate. I know it's not a win but I I tell you it was not easy to drive with with the rain so yeah exactly. Well done guys. Bravo.
[810/6155] OCO: And that's the checkered Yes guys! Yes! 33, weld up! Yes! Oh my god! Oh my god! Ha ha ha! Wooo! Okay! I'm pretty well done. Fantastic weld up. Thank you so much guys. What a weekend, what a weekend. Finally what we deserve. Yes! I'd like to expert this way, weld up.
[811/6155] SAR: 
[812/6155] DEV: Yeah, the right hand mirror is filled with upwards, so we bring it down a little bit. Okay, so guys, let's take the tools on the grid.
[813/6155] LEC: and multifunction gx position to when you can gx to when you can
[814/6155] OCO: Ich bin jetzt schon für die Korde Mannschaft am Anste cleaning. Ich gebrauchteЫ
[815/6155] RUS: So clutch position was on target. Tractum currently is 41 degrees.
[816/6155] RUS: Just put a marker where I was losing the grip, a little bit before.
[817/6155] OCO: Yeah, not good, we didn't think 8th honestly, it's not enough to the watch as one lap.
[818/6155] OCO: Have a look at the balance also because very understeer high speed very very under steering like crazy understeer.
[819/6155] OCO: 
[820/6155] PIA: and Oscar will need a big lift in turn 10 for PU temperatures to protect the launch. How's the front wing flap? Copy. Front wing feels okay. Bit on that nose but it's going to ready for the front left a little bit so I think it's in a sensible place.
[821/6155] STR: can I answer tailwind entry to four entry to nine, headwind exit four up to 25k we're going to the grid
[822/6155] RUS: Yeah, just check gravel. Um, stuff. I was just trying to avoid lines.

[827/6155] HAM: She just wiped my mirrors out really dirty.
[828/6155] HAM: It's pretty hot man, it's sad.
[829/6155] LEC: So corrections, now is at the end of the pit lane and they are telling me he is on mediums.
[830/6155] HUL: Okay, Nico, tires. Everyone is on soft except we're stopping Perez Sargent on medium and the clerk is on hard from the pit lane.
[831/6155] HAM: And a reminder you do have HPP 12 currently in position 4.
[832/6155] OCO: Clutch drop was 2% too deep and held the clutch a little too long.
[833/6155] SAR: We are in exhilarating deep breath. Here comes the joy of your existence. A shallow breath, we have given you an ardour, we have yeighted by pleasure, eternity for you to gently hold peace in, Cabinaga,
[834/6155] OCO: Yeah, didn't hit every sound one. Let me know. Copy.
[835/6155] LEC: and just a confirmation that everything is okay on the car.

[990/6155] HAM: Corsair caution, you can do it just that, just that. Great job with something else.
[991/6155] ALO: You had to pray there, yeah, look pretty dangerous to me.
[992/6155] RUS: And just feed back on the car. It's a bit bent but it's okay.
[993/6155] HAM: What has the damage come from? That is off at Georgia Scarably.
[994/6155] HAM: We're at breaks. It's really hot.
[995/6155] LEC: Comments from Sunaudar regarding the hearts, warm up was worth and expected around one second so we are expecting the cars in front to struggle initially.
[996/6155] OCO: So it's officially been looked at by the FIA in terms of car positioning. Again, I'll let you know if there's any update. Thank you. We're staying in this position and we're carrying on from here. The five cars in front haven't stopped. Yeah, but let's not say I'm going to stay behind now. It's been, it's under investigation for overtaking under the safety car so the good boy will get penalties. So can I head down?
[997/6155] NOR: Lando, for the first lap, it's the same rules of engagement as we had on lap one of the race.
[998/6155] PIA: So that's Albon behind. Prior to here is Albon. We need to keep him behind you.
[999/6155] OCO: I think he's let you through. I'll let you know.
[1000/6155] MAG: Mae felorthodraidd felog llllol sydol yn f— yn eff cal.
[1001/6155] MAG: Cup behind his album. Would be nice to know what tyres they're on so I know what to expect. Copy, they're all on hearts, all these cars are on hearts.
[1002/6155] SAI: Yeah, I think I have a bit of place here.
[1003/6155] LEC: And as we want to clean, we want to clean and fast, steam, science will not attack you.
[1004/6155] LEC: And as we want to clean, we want to clean and fast, steam, science will not attack you.
[1005/6155] VER: I've looked up on this tyre. Yeah, I copied that mix.
[1006/6155] SAI: 
[1007/6155] PIA: We still think Plan A.
[1008/6155] VER: I'm just losing grip with this fire now. Yeah, okay, back. So I think we've got that message. Thank you. Just head down.
[1009/6155] RUS: If this one continues like this, don't go ahead overtake. Just two months. Yes, so George, we're hoping that these cars in front are going to stop again. Move out of our way.
[1010/6155] HAM: Generally, This- We're in this predict-
[1011/6155] OCO: There's a few cars switching to two stops now, we're still thinking planning.
[1012/6155] NOR: And Lando, do you think the rear tyres are recovering? No, they're getting worse. Lando, if we think the tyres aren't going to recover, then we will box this lap. I want your feedback. But it's impossible for me to know if they're going to cover it. Okay, so we would... Lando, we will have to overtake possibly six cars. But if we generally think... If we think they're not going to recover, this might be our best option rather than just falling out of the race. We will box this lap if you think this is true. Box this lap if you think I'm right.
[1013/6155] HAM: So it's about to use this tire up. Is there anything left in it? No, I've already used it.
[1014/6155] NOR: Lando, we have a 5 second penalty, we have a 5 second penalty, so we want to try and build the gap on the cars behind it. Oh, pushing is much better, huh?
[1015/6155] LEC: So, signs will not attack you.
[1016/6155] VER: There is a bit of a race on behind us, so people are pushing a lot more than you for the moment.
[1017/6155] ALO: Okay, get down here when the lift and coast is okay. Just not doing it. Yeah, we will do, but please keep doing it now. Please keep doing it. Yeah, I want to wind the race, mate.
[1018/6155] STR: There's a lot ahead still to get. I know, but I'm losing tire grip now.
[1019/6155] ALB: I think very important for some reclassing album defending, you got the straight line speed.
[1020/6155] RUS: So, I think we're going to be able to pass with a very nice beat. Okay, copy that. So, your focus right now needs to be on this brake, front left brake.
[1021/6155] ALO: Last lap, Hamilton half a second cooking.
[1022/6155] ALO: bekdall or slap Amazon cruise
[1023/6155] RUS: So we think we're going to have to retire this car in front of brake waves too high. So we want me to do. So call the car, just call the brakes down and we'll box end of this lap.
[1024/6155] RUS: So sorry everyone, nothing more to say. Sorry.
[1025/6155] LEC: So compared to Synth we are faster everywhere except turns 8 and 9 losing around a 10.
[1026/6155] HAM: Sounds like a lot of though is nursing a rear brake issue.
[1027/6155] ALO: 4cap את İngreths 1.9 3
[1028/6155] STR: I'm Terry Astaible. Yes, they could be. Flat out. Flat out, mate. Flat out. Six to go at the line.
[1029/6155] STR: going to get botas you'll stay five seconds in Norris and hope on does something without one ahead push hard
[1030/6155] VER: I was knocked myself out of that cap.
[1031/6155] LEC: That was Greenie-locking
[1032/6155] NOR: QS dann nutze? Es ist gerade gut! Als Nächster istікzeit zu sein Bis ungewaltete deutsche 들고
[1033/6155] HUL: Joe has the blue. He's got blue flag and he's attacking me. He's a Joker. Yeah, understood.
[1034/6155] ZHO: I'm sorry. It's not weird noise. That's hurt me on the ground. Copy, John.
[1035/6155] VER: Max Info, check out in Pitlane for a soft time. Really fine, I'm not tasting the fast fluff.
[1036/6155] VER: I'm from the good derby office. Yeah, I'm about that and also 100 win for the team. So that's a great result. Yeah, well done mate. That is as you said, a centry for the team. So fantastic and thank you for producing that race victory for us today. Well done mate. Yeah, maybe not the strongest track with the conditions, but it's so a very good result. It's all good.
[1037/6155] ALO: Well done mate, well done. We were nursing a little problem there but he did a great job. I think without that little problem the staff will do. I knew you didn't want to say anything. Well done guys, I'm happy. Happy. We gave her to him again and super pissed off. Well done mate, great job.
[1038/6155] NOR: What is the penalty for? I will talk about it later. Why are you just talking now? No, I will talk about it later.
[1039/6155] TSU: Check it out, thank you for watching. Thanks, Josh. For the last 3 years. Good luck if there are any. Bye bye.
[1040/6155] PER: Oh, Dave, not all week. Yeah, well done, Czecho. Good effort today. There's a tricky race out there, but a big, big last lap there. What for the past is that? Yeah, not a great weekend, but all the guys. Yeah. Little review it. Let's come back. Let's come back strong.
[1041/6155] STR: OK, last is P9. So you didn't get the rubber to green on the safety cam and we've come back brilliantly. So you've done a very good long stem on the hard, that's a really good job, mate. That's P9 well earned. Great job on the last lap.
[1042/6155] MAG: Okay, good. Obviously very disappointing race place in the car. The reference Nico finished B15. Yeah, so far race hasn't gone our way really so far this season, but hopefully we'll turn around if we just keep at it and keep working. Thanks for your other guys.
[1043/6155] VER: I know you don't have an answer numbers mates but it has race with 41 I think you want to sample that is so I would think about that the podium. That's excellent. Yeah hopefully it doesn't stop here though. Yeah as you see Centenary today Max we're going to send Adrian up to pick the trophy up so it's his 200th race win so you've got a few to catch him up. Yeah that will be a very long one.
[1044/6155] HUL: Checkered flag, Nico, checkered flag. Well, very good job holding him off. That's all we had left, eh? So we had left to fight for him? Yeah, man. We could see exactly what it was like. But good job.
[1045/6155] PIA: So Oscar that's P12. We were within five seconds of land over that of a comp P11. P11 just missed out. Yeah, copy here. Probably too late for a chicane. Yeah. It's tricky race. Thanks for the effort. Fixing the car your last night. Much appreciated. Well raised Oscar some some really good overtaking.

[1419/6155] VER: What was the difference 24 hours, Mike? I think it was the dinner. That was absolutely impressive. I mean, that first lap. And then they didn't see you for the rest of the day, so stunning. Yeah, the car was really, really good today. So we're going to send pedals up because he was around in 1988 when McLaren did 11. So 12 and a row is something to be really, really proud of and great to have check out there as well. Yeah, that was a great recovery as well. You cars on the podium, so really good. Max Ford has worked, he got your fastest lap as well. Yeah, very lovely that. Yeah, I did fastest pit as well, but 1.9 second fastest of the season. So it's been a good day all round. Yeah, the first one, because I'm going to felt the best. Actually apologies, but just check it out, you got the fastest stop, but yours were pretty slick as well. It's in the team, that's good.
[1420/6155] PIA: Hey up, thanks guys. I feel like I'm going to hang on to the tyres, but I have something to review. So I'm going to put them on the points. It's still being at the front. And yeah. I'm going to get them next week.
[1421/6155] PER: Okay, P3. I'm the podium. It's highly work. Good job guys. Well done, Checo. That is a great, great recovery. Great to have you on the podium today. 12 victories in a row. You've been part of that and that's history for the team. Amazing guys. One last time for everybody. Well, I'll record. And now it's time for Ready to be Hydra. Oh yeah. The big bottle or the little bottle? I think we can. He's getting all now. It's bigger than him. He's strong enough. There's some great race in there, Checo. Today it got a bit closer to turn three a few times, but you got your elbows out. Well done mate. Yeah. Yeah, they race hard these guys.
[1422/6155] RUS: George, well done, a super recovery and sorry we messed it up yesterday but the drive was really good. Really good.
[1423/6155] LEC: Good job, so P7 with the end, P7. P7 is behind George. Yes, right behind him. Shame for today, I thought like the pace was really good. I mean really good. I don't know what the other guys in front were doing, but at the beginning all of you. I thought like I was quite in a good place.
[1424/6155] ALO: Thank you, tonight.不起
[1425/6155] SAI: Charge off and both slow and pick up finish p8.
[1426/6155] STR: That's a good point from where we started, well managed early stop and you're clear, well clear of the people that stopped around you. So well done, good management in the middle. And it was a two stop race for everybody so we made that work well done. Take the pick up for Nanop 9 ahead of you.
[1427/6155] ALB: Yeah, thank you Alex. That was a mega job. So P11, obviously no points, but P11 is pretty good still. So that was a really good recovery after yesterday.
[1428/6155] BOT: So that was P12 for us in the end. Yeah, coffee. Share it with the test app and then knocking some face. Let's keep working.
[1429/6155] HUL: Good job Nico, holding him off. At least there are no loss of points to the main competitors for us. But, what's... beer is going to eventually run out for us. Yeah, copy that, we're keep working.
[1430/6155] TSU: We discussed in the office you did a good trace and then now we'll go through everything.
[1431/6155] ZHO: We finished P17, let's discuss the race afterwards of radio. Yeah, that was really nice at the start. I have no power. Did you guys see that you shoot or not? Because honestly, Joe, we discussed later. We discussed later, please. Copy.
[1432/6155] MAG: Okay, Kevin, that's the checkered flag. That's the checkered flag. Yep, so, Kevin, we were P-17 at the end of all of that. Um, yeah, another tough one, sorry mate.
[1433/6155] PER: 
[1434/6155] TSU: 
[1435/6155] TSU: 
[1436/6155] TSU: 
[1437/6155] ALB: It's a little question but you can't do a burnout. The pit box is the start position is quite close to the rather corner so it just doesn't
[1438/6155] ALB: Bye.
[1439/6155] TSU: I understood obviously, if he's going to be like that, I need to protect him from
[1440/6155] OCO: Okay, copy that. So we've just got a second gear to sync, but that's easy to don't know the formation up as well. Nothing to worry about.
[1441/6155] PER: Okay, check out the first little salivary in four minutes.
[1442/6155] ZHO: 19 minutes, 19 minutes to go, light rain expected in 4 minutes, 3 minutes.
[1443/6155] BOT: The rain will hit the track in 5 minutes.
[1444/6155] MAG: Okay, the weather is coming. So to adjust some switches, could you go to break belt 58.5?
[1445/6155] LEC: So reported heavy rain turn 15 and it will last for 20 minutes.
[1446/6155] HUL: 15 minutes more rain, this intensity lower and then high again and they're still saying it's going to start formation that's going to be in nine minutes
[1447/6155] BOT: This rain sale should be over in 2-3 minutes and then we have 5 minutes lighter rain and then the next heavy rain is expected.
[1448/6155] PER: I hope it is the next one that is coming, it's as big as this one.
[1449/6155] RUS: I mean, I'm underneath a tent, I just feel sorry for everybody for grandstands. So what do you think like removing the tent to have the real feeling? Not too sure the mechanics would appreciate that, but unless you want to come and stand in a ring with us. Are you not on the grid, Toto? I feel like you should be standing here. Yeah, for loyalty, you know. Yeah, you know, it's even springing into the garage. I'm thinking closing the doors here now.
[1450/6155] ZHO: The next heavy shower is expected in 2-3 minutes.
[1451/6155] SAI: So there's heavy rain coming still.
[1452/6155] SAI: Men tre te för mig, Liga
[1453/6155] HAM: 
[1454/6155] HAM: 
[1455/6155] RIC: What's the, how does it look?
[1456/6155] RIC: So actually we just installed, we expect another heavy shower, 3 minutes from now, and then that's it.
[1457/6155] RIC: very heavy was coming but it's a short shower in a couple of minutes.
[1458/6155] HAM: But they give us a 10 minute warning. Everybody. He's gonna pull it like that. Yeah, they will give us a 10 minute warning.
[1459/6155] NOR: The latest update from Niels is that they're expecting the rain to stay around until 20 past. At the moment they would then expect to start the race behind the safety car, which clearly mandates the wet, but we're currently waiting for the weather to improve.
[1460/6155] LEC: So these range should stop in 5 minutes and then we have a gap of an hour with no range.
[1461/6155] SAI: Guys, it is important for me to know if at the end of the formation lab when the safety car comes in. I can follow the safety car in and put an inter or I need to start the rolling start or the standing start on an extreme and then box at the end of the first lab. This is what is important to know.
[1462/6155] GAS: This is the team right ahead of us. Make sure they don't block us.
[1463/6155] OCO: The second gear start with a 40% clutch paddle drop and just a normal drop and release.
[1464/6155] SAI: Ricky, we will need to be very careful, we are perfect in the building, everyone will box and I will be going out to everyone. Which I will be? Yeah, and a good call traffic.
[1465/6155] PER: but it will be like you say it might dry up very quickly
[1466/6155] ALO: Okay, for now to see what bad information there will be at least two laps following the safety car around. There will be two laps following the safety car.
[1467/6155] HAM: We're not doing a stand-in start. No, it's standard. So as we're planning but behind a safety car, we still do a second gear launch.
[1468/6155] RUS: ==er
[1469/6155] VER: Okay, at the moment the plan is for four laps behind the safety car, four laps and then it will be a rolling start. At the notice, what decision?
[1470/6155] OCO: So we believe we've got one more lap, safety car will come in at the end of it, that's what we believe so far.
[1471/6155] VER: That's right quick. Yeah, you could definitely already drive a ticket in to us.
[1472/6155] STR: My decision is to discuss on the grid. Copy that. Copy that. If we think of something, depending on what others do. Yeah, we think it's the right thing.

[1632/6155] HUL: So whether I wise there is rain building, sometimes it disappears, so we're kind of prepared for that with our tire choice. Okay, and then we went through all the data and what we're happening with our tires, we've reverted the maps degree adjust. It was just too much, it took out too much front, and then we've corrected for the tire compounds for the race start. So we basically used the first lap, first lap air balance, and then just corrected for the delta for the tire. Yeah, that's correct.
[1633/6155] VER: Okay, first thing is weather update. That cell that I set to be hitting around 10 laps into the race that look quite short and sharp, that is maybe breaking up a little bit or at least using it intensity. So I'll keep the update to the first four laps of the race. May world is something we can drive through this day now, but it's a board looking like it. I'm going to require the first switch to it. Okay, full vehicle out presentation. Bo 12, the W-Lawton. Pit limiter off and a static 5.5, 1st car is on the ground. Carry out, the practice starts at 30 years normal and then through the full vehicle out. Target as much, tire warming as possible. Lift the coast, it's 1013 and half the 1013, no more. It's 10% trouble. It turns the burnout from the left hand side to the firemire, shall post. That's just before the final painted crib spot. To the left hand side, firemire to post. We are looking for four locks, burnout, four lock burnout and an extra ramp rather than a coach of ours, your start position. At least 4.5, any changes I will communicate to you.

[1636/6155] PIA: Class hall right in the bit lane. Yeah, some load drops as well on the visor.
[1637/6155] ALO: So we expect the heaviest drain is going to come, but it hits sector three in about one minute time. So it could be on this first lap. We'll keep you updated. So keep an eye on your grid box position when you line up.
[1638/6155] MAG: Expecting the most intense rain turn 1314.

[1642/6155] VER: You can live with it, stay up. You need to tell me the way down. Yeah, I'm just a fact. I think we'll be at this light box.
[1643/6155] NOR: Okay, Lando, Bren is easy enough. Can you keep the track on track? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1644/6155] HAM: We should have come in, man. This is very wet. Copy, Lewis. So we're going to stay out. We're going to have to brave this, I think.

Okay, so we've been is getting lighter now. Can we survive it? You think? Definitely, yes, yes. Yeah, copy. So definitely care for the level now. Smooth tarmac. Okay, it's you less knows you come in, but it's still raining a bit to the pen and bit of lighter. We. I think I don't know. I can survive. It's one minute or so. You can follow those other cars.
[1646/6155] RUS: and a rain intensity reducing in the pit lane now. Still right here and here, very well. Take a press behind on the inter. So, press alongside.
[1647/6155] OCO: Okay mate half the field have not pitted, they're all bunched up between 11 and 13, we can get a load of people here.
[1648/6155] PER: Okay, gap to Russell 14 seconds. Russell the first car on the slick tire.
[1649/6155] ALB: and then Magnuson behind on Inter. So Alex is really good, these guys are going to have to pit again soon for dry.
[1650/6155] LEC: And more raining in expected in six laps light intensity.
[1651/6155] NOR: The box mate, let me take slow. We are faster than in disguise. What the f- are you f- Keep it mate. Box! Let me put it in!
[1652/6155] SAI: And pass as a front wing damage, front wing jump damage for charge. Okay, don't slow me down please.
[1653/6155] RUS: This rain is coming, it's going to be lighter than before, two or three minutes out.
[1654/6155] MAG: But we still need to pit if we get a cab because if it's a small rain then these tires are going to be Copy, understood
[1655/6155] MAG: Use wet patches where possible, use wet patches where possible and VC1, please VC1. I'm not hearing anything about the gap dude. Sorry, the gap to stopping you'll come out in front of standby. You'll come out P12 if you stop now.
[1656/6155] ALB: HPP on, HPP on, and some people are now hitting back on to drives, taking a struggle with warmup.
[1657/6155] HUL: In two or three minutes we'll probably have light drizzle for a few minutes.
[1658/6155] BOT: about to take a few drops of rain but nothing major.
[1659/6155] NOR: So I just jump green F3, green F3. With thing, the rank will come in the next one to last. It will hit time 1 fast. It will light. Yeah, it's already at turn 1.
[1660/6155] VER: Okay, so all cars are now back on slicks. Car behind us. Check out three seconds. So think about the time management, please Max. Time management.
[1661/6155] PER: Give back 100 cutters. Yes, back 100 cutters.
[1662/6155] ALO: It was gasoline soon. I know what burns come from. Yeah, so everybody's on soft tyres except Joe. Joe was on the mediums. If a padded was not in in our pipe.
[1663/6155] PER: Okay so there's light rain on the staff industry. This is a bad little cap.
[1664/6155] RUS: Operation Card 4 x the podium Explosion
[1665/6155] PIA: I may have a massive flat squat now. Copy.
[1666/6155] MAG: for reference, Kevin. Nico's carrying ball speed through 7-8 and 13 just for reference.
[1667/6155] SAI: They look like they made a 9 big accident.
[1668/6155] SAI: And no more rain for the next 30 minutes.
[1669/6155] OCO: Safety car, safety car, stay out, stay out.
[1670/6155] SAR: You okay? No, I crashed. I don't know what happened to man. Something fell on the front right when I hit the curb. When I hit the curb.
[1671/6155] ALO: Just while we've got time, just take your air balance thoughts on that first partner.
[1672/6155] PER: Is there more rain expected? There are cells on the radar, first one 35 minutes away.
[1673/6155] STR: That's what's cool, that's what's cool. He's delta positive. We've done 18 laps last, a long way to go. There's more rain coming. June feels this is the best tire for the conditions. We think this is the best tire for the conditions and the context of the race. Make sure your brakes are working well.
[1674/6155] HUL: Okay, that's two times past safety car line one, so you can catch the pack. The main pack is going into seven. Okay, Nico, good job on brakes. You're with the pack now. So the people who have stopped is bot-tests on to medium, stroll on to medium, you and loss on to medium and Russell's going on to hard. Other people have not stopped yet. They're all still on soft. The next rain, if it comes, would be in like 25 laps. So we'll see what happens there. Otherwise we'll just see how long we can take this tire.
[1675/6155] SAI: Yeah, very difficult to capture with this safety gun.
[1676/6155] PER: So it will be flat here, not from here. Yeah, the bike will be some great in 15 laps, a great 25 laps. Hard to say how strong that will be at this point.
[1677/6155] PER: So it will be planned ahead from here. Yeah, the bike is great in 15 laps, a great 25 laps. Hard to say how strong that will be at this point.
[1678/6155] ALB: So starting lap 21, our current plan is plan B plus 10, plan B plus 10, but that should be achievable.
[1679/6155] HAM: Do you have reports that LeClerc may have had some damage so missing some of the rear downforce? Do you hear me? LeClerc car head. He was a 1.7 slower than the previous 8th car.

[1697/6155] OCO: There's a bit of a weird shift 617 under the corner. Copy that oil level.
[1698/6155] MAG: Need to get into Joe's DRS if possible, Kev. He has DRS from PS3 unfortunately.
[1699/6155] OCO: Okay, some of these switch changes are related to that shift. We're trying to improve it.
[1700/6155] ALB: Alex went a really good place so we're still extending this is an awesome job.
[1701/6155] VER: Okay, Max, expecting some very light rain in around five, six minutes. It will hit turn 8 and 13, but it is very light.
[1702/6155] HAM: No, sir, he gives a balance check. Very good. A bit of a lot of things.
[1703/6155] PIA: How's the trot? Still OK, put it out. No change.
[1704/6155] SAI: And I alive for the softest plus 10, plus 10. You left kick, we got back into the end. At the moment we don't think, but we are monitoring.
[1705/6155] RUS: So, I've currently got up to the B6 in our pit window. We are looking at points.
[1706/6155] SAI: How many more laps at this pace? At this pace, 10 more laps. But I'm worried about that. It's costly. It's going to go away. That's good. There's only 3.8 in front.
[1707/6155] HUL: 
[1708/6155] BOT: Couple of drops here of whatever was the forrogous thing

[1710/6155] HUL: He used 1010, he's unbelievable. And I know I was a 5 left left, don't say. Yeah, understood. Maybe try 10 without the left toggle just to see what it does.
[1711/6155] OCO: The science in front has pitted that puts us P6 at the moment.
[1712/6155] HUL: The Albon will be coming out on the medium.
[1713/6155] RUS: It's been 27 to go into this lap.
[1714/6155] OCO: How are we doing, Max Push on these tyres? Status three for now, please. Norris 1.4 behind, 26 laps to go.
[1715/6155] ALO: We can wait for gas, we can't fit, and he's getting a self-decade like this. Yeah, he's a gas, he has fitted now. Gas is just fitted, won't be long now for us.
[1716/6155] SAI: What we are doing with IS is very good, good job.
[1717/6155] ALB: Okay, Alex here now P8 Hamilton and PS3 pity behind us. Cara head his Russell four seconds on a really used hard. So at the moment Alex we think we're racing for P6. So P6 is on. Keep me updated about pace. Copy. If you keep doing 15 zeros that's perfect. Let's say quick thrust. Okay, copy will discuss it.
[1718/6155] OCO: possible rain in 15 minutes only like
[1719/6155] PIA: POSCO there's another shower approaching expected around lap 60 possibly later it has grown in intensity would last the remainder of the race.
[1720/6155] MAG: possible rain in 15 minutes, possible rain in 15 minutes.
[1721/6155] HUL: Turned 7-8 was good, it's 4, and then with the rain coming like 9 laps away, let's make this tire for 9 laps to get the lap time out of it.
[1722/6155] ALO: So there is a small chance of rain at about ten laps. I'll keep you updated. Good job mate. Good job. Good copy. Good job guys. Got a flying.
[1723/6155] TSU: I ta nieße, wyłas fragment w to bez w classmates Niłko've jak
[1724/6155] VER: So we are expected braid around 10 laps from the end max, some of which could be pretty heavy.
[1725/6155] ALB: us
[1726/6155] ALO: When the rain comes it will be heavier than the start of the race.
[1727/6155] ALO: Yeah, depth level here is good for none of them. Sure, there will be rain.
[1728/6155] NOR: Yeah, but I'm just so f**king annoying the better self. I can't do it.
[1729/6155] VER: Is it gonna be like extreme terror or into? It could say the moment I guess.
[1730/6155] HAM: So this rain is looking imminent and it will be heavy so you can use the tyres.
[1731/6155] HUL: We may have dropped soon, the big rain is 5 minutes away.
[1732/6155] TSU: Are you okay? The rain is coming last corner. If it's every rain, we are happy you to call the box.
[1733/6155] GAS: Okay, so this rain is two minutes away, duration is about 50 minutes.
[1734/6155] GAS: Okay, so this rain is two minutes away, duration is about 50 minutes.
[1735/6155] HUL: Great job, Nico. Just tell us everything you can about the conditions. We want to get on the right tire at the right time.
[1736/6155] HAM: So, I'll join to last part from a much different time strategy team. Yep, we try to get the message to him. Should be this straight.
[1737/6155] HAM: This is where I got the
[1738/6155] STR: Okay, Lance, 13 to go, 13 to go. Other teams thinking extreme wet. It could be extreme wet. We're considering it.
[1739/6155] VER: Oh, Fox is left. No, it's so dry here. Wait a second.
[1740/6155] HUL: Box now Nico box now
[1741/6155] VER: I think this would be a very good time to pit. Okay.
[1742/6155] OCO: This is going to be very, very heavy rain estimate, massive.
[1743/6155] OCO: Okay, maybe we need scenario 5. This is going to be extremely heavy rain. It's going to get much much heavier.
[1744/6155] OCO: Что!!! Этоlling
[1745/6155] GAS: I can't really see a thing in the street. Okay, we go in yellow tone 1, yellow tone 1. Press off.
[1746/6155] PER: I cleave the wall on the entry to the pit lane with the right hand. Copy? On the right. Copy, we'll have a look. What was it? Just the tire from wing. Do the tire. Okay. We'll get some first rubber on anyway. So are we going back a lap or not? Stand by will let you know when we have all the details. That's the normal thing. So we've done it before.
[1747/6155] ALB: So Alex, we're going to get at least 10 minutes warning if you want to jump out of the car depend.
[1748/6155] SAI: illist200 odSaavien
[1749/6155] ALB: So sorry about all those changes, I think I had to put a few tries to prepare the car for these conditions, which one gets much temp as we could. We've got another couple more, ready for the restart. So can you go green 9 position 7 please? And then when I've done green 8 position 1, then tyre switch to inter, which may change to full wet later on.
[1750/6155] MAG: So entering the pit lane and stopping in order, there are still eight laps to go at the end of this one.
[1751/6155] NOR: I'm going to need to change my helmet and everything anyway so it's fun to get out. It's so raining so it's not going to restart anytime soon. Were you talking? Like I didn't hear anything. Can you hear me? No. Yeah, no, no. Okay, sorry, we are losing the connection on my belt pack. You can jump out. Yeah, okay.

[1752/6155] LAW: So, most likely, the FIA will tell us which tire to use either inter or extreme, but if they don't, and if we have a choice, so the extreme could be good very initially for the rest out, but then the day will be higher than the inter. So we have seven laps remaining, and lucky to have a couple of safety car laps, so basically we probably have four or five rest laps remaining. So have a think, if you would like to try something, if you have a view, have a think, if you have a view, otherwise we decided for you. For me, if it's more than three or four laps, like more than three laps, four laps racing, then the ins are going to be better because I don't think they're going to let us race until it's condition where the inter is actually probably stronger. So I think the inter is better, but if it's like three or three laps, then the way it's maybe. Copy that. It's just because we're thinking about warm up. So the inter are really better, but we will have a couple of safety car laps, then a couple of warm up laps, so there won't be very much of racing at full tire temperature. That's why we are thinking about it.
[1753/6155] LAW: What was the penalty for the PEDA? So it was because of the reason for the penalty was because we impeded the pass for the PEDA because of doing the double stack. So nothing you could have done is because of the car position in the PEDA and what happened there. That was a good timing. Copy that, copy. I just wanted to know just in case it was made up. No, no, no, no. Yeah, as I tried to say, it was nothing to do with you. It's just timing in the PEDA and we did not work out. Yeah, no, no, no.
[1754/6155] LAW: So now we have a break in the rain, we have a break in the rain, it's stopping on next one expected in 15 minutes from now, 15 to 20 minutes.
[1755/6155] LAW: Okay, that's the 8 minutes warning for you Liam. 8 minutes warning restart in 10 minutes and we will exit the bit and in 8.
[1756/6155] MAG: Okay, so it's intermediate tires for the restart behind the safety cut.
[1757/6155] MAG: Yeah, I guess you've had two laps behind the safety car and then a rolling start.
[1758/6155] LAW: We will do 2 laps beyond the safety car on then 5 rest flaps. Everyone will be on the inter. We have done as much as we could to help you with tires on brakes. We bring it to the bag.
[1759/6155] RUS: current expecting two laps behind the safety car and we have the inter tyre fitted that was mandatory from the FIA
[1760/6155] HUL: Yeah, loud and clear. Okay, so it's restarting on an inter. We go two minutes early, along with all these people to unlapped ourselves. There will be two total laps under the safety car, and then six racing laps remaining after that. Okay, so we're still on our interbalance and inter switches, which is all fine.
[1761/6155] PER: I could check us out, we've got the Intertire fit, and everyone is on the Inter.
[1762/6155] VER: Really you tech? Loud and clear Max. That's three and a half minutes until the race resumes for you. Now in one and a half minutes the laps cars will leave the pit lane. We'll then move you back into the pass lane once they've all left the pit lane. You will then follow the safe car out eventually. I can confirm it is a rolling start procedure. The safe car will stay out for two laps, two laps. That would lead six racing laps.
[1763/6155] VER: and turn this first lap behind the safety car max, but I could also use all gears just to make sure we were safe, sick. If you can.
[1764/6155] STR: And it's going to be expecting two laps behind the safety car launch. Keep the tire temp up as much as you can, tires and brakes.
[1765/6155] ALO: So maybe in eight minutes there's some very light rain but nothing serious.
[1766/6155] VER: It's home for weather update, maybe some light rain expected in six, seven minutes, Max. It is only light.
[1767/6155] RUS: For info there is more light rain on the radar, five minutes out. So it will be a rolling start procedure. The safety car will end with a hit lane end of this one. Can you put the noise on board on your screen? Let me know if he's inside or outside. Down the sound tray. I think it's going to be too delayed to be of any use to you. I'll try and keep an R on GPS and let you know.
[1768/6155] GAS: So mid-trees available, mid-trees available, press under investigation for speeding in a pit lane so you want to stay within five seconds if you can.
[1769/6155] ALO: It's a possible debris 10-11-12 overhead, possible debris 11-12.
[1770/6155] SAI: 4 laps to go, 4 laps to go There's radio! Copy
[1771/6155] ALB: mode 9 when you can for performance
[1772/6155] BOT: Okay, that's Hayasa. Oh, and now I'll study the work.
[1773/6155] VER: you all the way around.
[1774/6155] ALO: That's it mate, P2, well done. I think that's my favourite one. The fast is that as well. Yeah, I think this one, I'll start the first one yet. But we will win one race soon. We have to get closer. Well done guys.
[1775/6155] ALO: So happy mate. I thought we could have a go in my one but we didn't have any chance that I was ready to try. Yeah, well done. Well done mate.
[1776/6155] GAS: That's what I like baby. That's what I like. Really good race. Really good race. You guys can be proud very well executed. And you mate. Nice job. Very nice job. So really one for the team this one. Awesome job. Awesome job. Thank you.
[1777/6155] PER: Hard like check out unfortunately the speeding was on the way into the bit lane for the red flag. I think it was a good drive today. It was a good drive. I think they call on that first lap. What a shame. Sorry the tyres weren't really on the second one which was a late call but we were very late.
[1778/6155] SAI: 素敵なもの出来ることでしょはずえてました今日はあんはスタカルですかあんはということです早く空である陣的だガーパ right
[1779/6155] LAW: Okay, so you keep going to penalty on that P13 for you today. P13, good and bad. Good and bad. I think you should be pleased. Cool. Yeah, considering the amount of time that we lost at the start. Yeah. Get your own. I enjoyed that. Okay, glad you enjoyed it. Still a lot of work ahead. We'll get ready again. Unfortunately, the penalty is very unfortunate. But you did all the right things today. We'll review the details for next time. Yeah, for sure. At the very last. I started to get a bit more over feeling on the soft. I got clean. Yeah. That medium said I didn't feel very comfortable on. But I started to get more of an understanding on that soft. Yeah, I hope that on the we wanted to try something on the medium because there were not too much to lose. But yeah, the soft was a good compound.
[1780/6155] RUS: Yeah, take me so we shall see today right quick we cam...
[1781/6155] HAM: That was a Hexic one, so yeah, P6 final position. Really great drive and yeah, let's say Hexic day. Thanks a lot, guys. So the job done with the best stops. Thank you for the hard work. Let's keep it up and fight. It's not the day we wanted. Yeah, yeah, right on the Lus, not the day we wanted, but we'll keep battling on.
[1782/6155] TSU: And 0 grip. And 1, 1, 1, basic thing, whatever. I go 5 seconds for contact with Racer. Yeah, of course, they got a gaping. Devo course.
[1783/6155] PIA: I think if you missed opportunities, sorry for the lock up. That's nice to recover back to the points. And yeah, back at it again next week. So, have some fun. Yeah, good job today. Thank you.
[1784/6155] NOR: Yeah, not our best, executed rice, obviously, but still some points on the board about both of us well done, but you know, we need to do better. Yeah, I like to review. But still, P2 and Kualaise, so a lot of good things, we want to make a perfect, so just keep pushing. Sure. Don't mind, still, you're in the structures when you come to stop.

[1785/6155] BOT: Okay, so that was B17 for us in the end. Yeah, copy. So it is fairly good. One up again and faction. It's only getting better at the last two laps. But yeah, like I said, we've missed a bigger opportunity today in the beginning. Yep, understood. I can vouch you correction on the B15. So you know that I had a penalty and there was a rustle behind.
[1786/6155] HUL: It's not much possible there. I mean, could go this way these guys, but not overtake. Yeah, copy that, man. It's a good job today by you. It's really good overtakes in the dry too. And then, yeah, you did what we could. So P12.
[1787/6155] OCO: Okay, and that is the check of the flag. As you finished, P10, the front pair has got a penalty before speeding in the pit lane. Before everything restarted again. So that puts P3rd C4 podium. Which is good for the team.
[1788/6155] ALB: Yeah, that's checkered flag checkered flag. So P8. Yes, why don't everyone. That was a tough race. I think I could have done a bit better on that second call to pick there, but I mean, we've got really strong pace. We should be very proud of that. There was even P6 on pure pace there. That was amazing. In a way of it disappointed, but I don't everyone. Alex, well done. You drove out really today and we didn't get it all right. As you said, on Sisions, that's our shoulders as well. But you caught back up and in a dry race, you would have finished six on merit. Either way, well done. There's some difficult conditions across this weekend. You've got really good points. Yeah, thanks, Sam. I think we do it that some of the clicker cards behind us, I felt a bit more risk with the fitting early thing because I could. Yeah, a couple of you know, we'll review it. But in the meantime, I told you we're going to come here and finish eight. You would have been to my elbow. Thank you. Why didn't everyone?
[1789/6155] LAW: And we still don't have the push to go on now. Okay, copy. I was going to just use it after I started, but copy I don't know. Thank you.
[1790/6155] ALO: How much it was? So it was good, it basically plus two plus two and then you brought it back a bit because of the whirlspin, but the initial drop was good.
[1791/6155] MAG: Okay, careful, you'll be brought back into the garage with the engine running for that front wing adjustment.
[1792/6155] NOR: Don't break traction and launch the end of the fitting. Launch the back, you will target plus one, target plus one.
[1793/6155] RUS: It seems to be a bit more bounty than yesterday, nothing substantial. A few point ones safe. I will check a look at the data on that bounty.
[1794/6155] GAS: and we still need to sync first gear first gear
[1795/6155] STR: Okay, you can push your brakes now that was wrenching teblance no issues so box so go to the grid one more lap we'll go to the grid
[1796/6155] HUL: You can try Funk 3 for Understeer Turn 11 just to get a feel.
[1797/6155] ZHO: There's a problem on the anti-store guys. I'm not releasing by control. Copy, Joey, checking now. I paid extra attention still same.
[1798/6155] LAW: So my left camera has come loose, it's disconnected from the frame.
[1799/6155] ZHO: Where's the car? To the grid now, full switch off. Push each other, full switch off. Yeah, let's have a look what we can do. The issue we had was open the last one, but... Something without notice. Joey, were you discussed with you on the grid?
[1800/6155] LEC: Tämä on järjestelmä, että järjestelmä on 6-7. Tämä on järjestelmä, että järjestelmä on järjestelmä, mutta se on tullut. Ja, mutta se on tullut, mutta se on tullut. 2,5. Totta on. Okei. Tämä on tullut. Ja, on tullut. 4,5. Sitten on 8,9. Mutta tämä on järjestelmä, että järjestelmä on järjestelmä, että järjestelmä on järjestelmä. Ja 0,0.
[1801/6155] VER: Radio 10X. Yeah, Radio 10X. Lamently. So, formation lap procedures, 012, the dominant and formation lap, pit limiter off, and a static 5.5 at once, the car is on the ground. Carry out your launch to third gear, and then do the formation lap, looking for, ground plus 15 on your rear left, plus 15 on your rear left, target, if you feel should be possible to achieve it. Now lift the coast into turn 11, and no more than 50% throttle from there. From side and script position, which is grid slot 15, another reminder, arbitrary pit wall is speed 14. One lock, one short, and an extra rampant rather closer down with your sub position.
[1802/6155] OCO: Okay mate, so everyone on medium tyres, apart from Hamilton, who's on their side up in P8, Fortas, who's a couple of cars ahead, and Magnus in there on the hard track.
[1803/6155] GAS: and on fires everyone on medium except Hamilton, Magnuson and Botas on the hard. Botas the guy right there for Zoya. Yeah you got Magnuson behind you. And then Botas ahead on the right. Let's swallow him.
[1804/6155] HAM: So Clutch position was on target so it looks like an album. He's on a used medium. We have a new to fit
[1805/6155] ZHO: Copper, right lines.
[1806/6155] TSU: 
[1807/6155] MAG: If it's an aborted start, you need to have the pit limiter on.
[1808/6155] LEC: The car is not turning really well in the right hand corners. He's all good. On data with ESFINE. Copy good.
[1809/6155] PIA: Okay, there are currently double yellows from turn 8 to turn 11. Sonoto is stopped on the right hand side at the entry to turn 11. They may have cleared the car by the time we get there.
[1810/6155] PER: high temps are good
[1811/6155] PER: I had so many push when I did the start as I came off the throttle and you push a bit. Copy, I'm going to look.
[1812/6155] ALO: So Fernando we're going to be stopping on the grid so don't do any burnouts. I keep to the left now, there's food on the track. So no burnouts, you'll be stopping on the grid, the mechanics will come back out to you and there'll be a five minute restart process.
[1813/6155] VER: Okay Max, we're expecting that you race start to be aborted so expecting you to switch your engine off and be at a 5 minute delay.
[1814/6155] PER: What a man's way they didn't just remove the car. Believe it, it's stuck in gear so I have a few issues.
[1815/6155] LEC: Have been here.
[1816/6155] LEC: So we will do another formation lap and then the race will be two laps shorter. Here, a coffee. The mechanics are going to consider the grid. A bill is there on their way.
[1817/6155] ALB: The cenotes goes on the flatbed with an ability to start, we should be allowed back on the grid and the restart five minutes, but currently can't get access to the grid.
[1818/6155] SAI: Yeah, move it to the top, then we will go for a standing step. We will do another formation, though, but... Yeah, correct.
[1819/6155] LEC: So it tells it's the same for everyone here we cannot go into the truck okay. Nice, I was starting to wonder whether you were coming from Rome by walk. I'll hear that.
[1820/6155] PER: So you know just cars on its way back to the pit lane now. We did not yet have the 5 minute warning. Will you going to keep the same tires? Yes we are.
[1821/6155] SAR: 
[1822/6155] GAS: Yeah, let me know in terms of PU temps on the first formation lap if there's anything you want me to do different good ideally I still want to push for real tires. Yeah, copy that name, we'll let you know. Even yesterday we'll probably be thinking like that.
[1823/6155] SAR: Okay, so on your side just chill, get me a drink, try to relax as much as possible in the hot formula one coin this with it, sit tight and keep you updated.
[1824/6155] ZHO: Joe, Chris here. We will... sorry Joe, we will need to relearn the gears. So do a practice start as normal and then in turn one, make sure you go down to first gear again to learn it. Yeah, copy up. During the practice session, it was really hard to learn first gear, but I'll try again. I'll show you. Okay. Yes Joe, in the formation lap, we expect everyone to be very slow and turn one and two.
[1825/6155] PIA: and I'll scare the race distance will have been shortened by two laps because you've got another formation right now.

[1827/6155] GAS: five minutes ago. We're going to want to talk. And once the engine is fired, that means we're on. We will do a bite. And then do the first gears. Okay, radio radio is still quite poor. Did you say scenario one, talk six? Thank you. Okay. On the other hand, anything better? I can do on a commercial app or call good. So suggest more weaving. You can do more weaving at the temperature. Okay.
[1828/6155] SAI: and everybody on the same time as before.
[1829/6155] HUL: So, a flaskier sink need to do that again. Yep, that's correct and loud and clear. So, one and a half minutes we'll get into it. So, sink the gears on the outlet, formation left.
[1830/6155] VER: Okay Max, the procedure will be the same however I would like you to target between 12 and 15 no more than 15 on the real earth you were up to 20.
[1831/6155] OCO: Okay, let's drop spot on. Good job.
[1832/6155] ALO: So maximum temperature when you can on the tyres and then good lifts then a good break
[1833/6155] OCO: Okay, let's do what we can to work those tires on the way around, please.
[1834/6155] STR: So the lean on the tyres now lots, good work on the tyres, weaving high speed then lift into Term 4, make some space.
[1835/6155] SAI: max.9.9
[1836/6155] BOT: on the right side have a height go
[1837/6155] SAI: 1 second, 1.0
[1838/6155] ZHO: So just entry plus one. Not fair. Dearest enabled. Special to available for turn 6 and 7.
[1839/6155] VER: 
[1840/6155] RUS: Christian front left brake times I think a tarot may have run him. We're looking. Brakes look okay currently.
[1841/6155] GAS: So gap to Esteban is 0.4 and everyone in a DRS train up to Albin in P6.
[1842/6155] LEC: and easy braking energies into turn one got to Russell behind 1.7

[1854/6155] VER: He's struggling with the rear wax a lot.
[1855/6155] SAI: And if we made the last one, well the balance did meet the last one, 0.6 behind.
[1856/6155] MAG: Careful we're thinking a big change on from wing flap. Back to start of formation, laps to grid. Do you agree? Yeah, agree. Copy.
[1857/6155] NOR: Ok now our goal here is reach dial your lap, potentially, plan B dial your lap, so think if I'm standing behind Hamilton, Alonso is 4 seconds behind and we are opening up with him he's holding a train of cars. Yeah I know but I can't save that much because how much is catching a lot, he's a little quick with this point so I'm trying to pick up the pace.
[1858/6155] SAI: Oh, is the situation behind Mugs? It's a gap of 2.5 to Russell before. Russell up to 27-2 is low in check-on-down.
[1859/6155] HUL: Balance is tricky, 6, 7, very understeer, but the rest is really really limited. It's not great. Understood, Nico.

[1862/6155] ALB:

[1864/6155] PER: He pushed me off.
[1865/6155] RUS: Just massive entry over steering to the high speed.

[1869/6155] MAG: Our sector 2 is good, we lost a tenth and a half in sector 1 and the rest in sector 3 so it's straight line speed again obviously.
[1870/6155] HAM: Just keep your arm in the front left oxidation. Norris at 27.8.
[1871/6155] PIA: First, let's make use of the free air now. We want to pull away from Alonzo doing 26-9. You're in the window for safety car and virtual safety car.
[1872/6155] ALO: Okay, it's the last lap they were 27 twos. Yeah, gots ahead. Still all clear and all, pit window behind.

[1883/6155] VER: Fernando is coming in Max.
[1884/6155] RUS: Check with the rear wheel at the front face
[1885/6155] BOT: Yeah, you can calculate about one second loss time loss per car. Copy, understood. A good job, we built a four and a half second gap to all come behind now.
[1886/6155] OCO: Okay mate, so for now we think we're racing, a group of cars on a two-stop which are about ten seconds behind. Let's keep going for now, please, album 1.9 behind. Goby, steering getting heavy on high braking. Okay mate, no, two, four, done it. Okay, understood, yeah, we're looking into that now.
[1887/6155] OCO: Okay, my on our grips stats we see rear tires stable, possibly improvement to be expected in the next few laps. I'll one just behind now.
[1888/6155] MAG: I think I do need to punch in turn six to create a steer if that answers the crowd. Understand, Kev, I'll get back to you. Anyway, I think we're looking at Blancy, you know. We're looking at Plan B, which I think is what you're talking about. Plan C was the first lap shuffle. Copy.

[1892/6155] OCO: Okay, so going onto the hard target and want to turn down on the front wing, keeps informed about column talk on the exit, please. It's not the talk, it's looking. Keep a tooth of the gearing is broken, you know what I mean? Okay, understood, yep. We're looking at it, we do see something in data. There's no forgets, worst, please, magmas and we'll come out just in front on pit exit.
[1893/6155] STR: Other car 269 but we need to do the lifting coast. He's doing lifting coast and is faster. It's quicker that way helps the tyres.
[1894/6155] LEC: So, signed in front is catching Hamilton. Still Hamilton with the first set.
[1895/6155] MAG: Place of the main group of cars ahead of years around 27 to now.
[1896/6155] STR: Good job on the left in coast, we like talk 11 but I'll leave you alone.
[1897/6155] NOR: Land of Carhead, Albon is struggling a lot with that rear end, he's been 27-0.

I was not saying anything about which way that's falling to saying it's being looked up. Yeah, I mean, in all of them, I think we're okay. That was pretty busy, 250 years race check over.

I just pulled out last minute to stop him from hitting me. So sorry, but I can't do that every single time he tries to take a launch. I take a voting action. I thought he would have this one icon show, but he didn't. Here's a good race Alex, as you say, strategy was on point. He did the best to do what he had there. Good work, I believe we'll reveal it after the race.

Yeah, it would be a lucky start after such a good pull away. These two pieces together are better than the other towers. We can't see the way we were.
[2168/6155] BOT: 
[2169/6155] ZHO:

[2194/6155] ALB: Still, it brings a lot of breaks.
[2195/6155] SAI: Guys, it's all the way to the other position. Okay, we will the third event and we are thinking of changing the settings in case that they should be okay. I'll let you know.
[2196/6155] PIA: Oscar the moment where you can see the soft cars have a good grip we know it'll come to the medium. Let's keep this cool what is going to come like to in this sprint.

[2213/6155] RUS: So safety cards. We need a box. Stay out. I think we need to box. Ties are done. The medium guard is going to overtake us. Whoever's on medium is just going to overtake us. We really think we need a box. Sure cool. So staying out. Staying out. Yeah, there'll be no points at all if we stop.
[2214/6155] HAM: That's my pace picking up a little bit there.
[2215/6155] HAM: A-firm, yeah, pace is looking good. The software does struggle.
[2216/6155] VER: I'm starting to see some surface damage. I don't know what I'm trying. I'm trying with the Osterisks. Forget about Piaşri, we need to get to the end. I told you about this. Let it come to you. We need to get to the end.
[2217/6155] PIA: Now there's still a f*** all over the track. It's not too... ...sets go just run over heaps of it.
[2218/6155] SAI: Careful for debris especially with the front axle giving that it is suffering.
[2219/6155] PIA: So, reminder on overtake, we'll need to recharge off when you're ready. We want to open a good gap to Russell to protect them from the staff.

[2223/6155] NOR: I suggest red A5, red A5, two laps to go.
[2224/6155] VER: I'm a real home X, you are a three time champion. Fantastic. Max, you are a three time world champion. That's unbelievable, mate. Absolutely unbelievable. It has been an incredible year for you. Yeah, unbelievable, guys. Yeah, I don't know what to say, but an incredible year. I mean, thank you for providing me with such a car. It's been a pleasure and so far this year. And it's not the same big tank. We're everyone here at the track. I can defect re putting all the effort in, you know, to be able to achieve something like this. I can't thank you all enough. And besides all the performance related stuff, it's also just really enjoyable to work with you all. That's probably even the most important at the end. So thank you very much.
[2225/6155] PIA: Very nicely done everyone. Thank you. I had a bit of a hard attack when all the soft guys went past the start but very well managed and yes thanks for the toys update as well.
[2226/6155] HAM: Amazing, impressive. Lots of girl and a team.
[2227/6155] ALB: Yes, almost need to figure out if the car was so good compared to this weekend. So it's a good place to be for tomorrow.
[2228/6155] ALB: I mean both trials went off in 10-4 or I don't know what Ferrari went for, 10-12 and 10-13 so 14-13.
[2229/6155] ZHO: At least we tried the tires for tomorrow but yeah.
[2230/6155] STR: I'll just end the race, that's it. Check the flag. Out 3, out 3. HPP button off.
[2231/6155] TSU: So what's sliding?
[2232/6155] BOT: Second safety car was a bit too long. I think the soft drive us would have struggled otherwise.
[2233/6155] GAS: Yeah, I tried. I tried but...
[2234/6155] ALO: Take a plug, take a plug, P9.
[2235/6155] HAM: So Louis tomorrow with a good starting position we know what can happen. Very good. So, did the car win? Oh yeah, so we got the gas repeat one. Amazing, aggressive. Let's go on the team.
[2236/6155] RUS: George, that was a very strong race and very well held on. Unfortunately not the podium. A lap was missing but it was a very very strong drive. And the move was good. Thanks George. Have an easy day.

[2335/6155] ALB: Great nice job hit down clean laps now clean laps.
[2336/6155] MAG: What do you think we're thinking for this? I disagree.
[2337/6155] GAS: Why am I clipping so much more?
[2338/6155] GAS: Yeah, we're having issues with that mate.
[2339/6155] VER: So we are snitch at 12 laps max and are snitch at 11 laps if we split the do

[2341/6155] TSU: We'll take a taxi. We'll take a taxi. We'll take a taxi.
[2342/6155] PER: Set another 5 second penalty for Jack Limits. Just hearting our base.
[2343/6155] SAR: I don't feel well man. Are you retiring mate? Are you retiring? You're cool buddy. You're the one making a call if you want to retire or not Logan. There's no shame to retire if you're feeling unwell. You're on yourself.
[2344/6155] LEC: And you are driving very well, good laps.
[2345/6155] MAG: Okay, okay, there are three cars inside our pit stop window still to stop so P11 is realistic.
[2346/6155] PER: The bicycle TV in the car just obviously is possible.
[2347/6155] LEC: Albon has to stop again.

[2351/6155] ALB: Okay, next we're going to need to crack on it. We've got 10 laps to go. So five second time penalty track with it's done 12.
[2352/6155] NOR: And we see that and we know that it doesn't matter. We worried a little bit about Russell, got 13.4 ahead. We think he might put a soft on towards the end of the race and be quick. Exactly, you're worried? So...
[2353/6155] LAW: On Liam we see a few issues with engine braking. We are trying to see what we can do. We have to deal with it for now.

[2363/6155] OCO: No, it's just to help sock control but keep doing it please.
[2364/6155] MAG: Remember he has a five second penalty so he only needs to be within that five seconds at the end. That's all I'm thinking about.
[2365/6155] MAG: Sorry, Albon has a 10-second penalty apparently, so we have plenty of margin.
[2366/6155] GAS: keep watching ghost track limits mate
[2367/6155] VER: What a max, so that was a bit very challenging. What a really quality drive, well managed. Well, our max, that is, as GPs says, that was a proper quality drive. So we just wanted to cover off all the venturalities at the end there, so great drive. Good win. It was a bit close for comfort, I think the last hit, but the pace was okay. Another win, that's unbelievable. There you go, the three pole fastest lap on the wind, well done.
[2368/6155] PIA: Reach our Johnny's good. Great job mate. Keeping the podium streak going. Where are we? Thanks guys. That was probably the hardest race I've ever had in my life. Yeah.

[2374/6155] LAW: I'm really struggled obviously. The whole race just, it was like an i-feet so I could not commit properly.
[2375/6155] PER: Okay, I think after all the pelleties are applied that will be P10. Clip.
[2376/6155] RUS: Good job racing back there up to P4. It looked difficult from the start. Yeah, I'm warning everybody. Sorry about what happened at the beginning. It's due to come together and I'll share it. But Miss Weekend, you guys did a really good job processing work. I think everything has been brilliant. I'm just going to go in so long as I can see the bump. Quit it all right.

[2380/6155] VER: And on the podium, Max, today your engineer, Gianparo will be Jim Piro, or GP. We'll be joining you, so make sure you get plenty of abuses who usually do. I'll try my best.
[2381/6155] OCO: I'll tell you I'm throught by LAR 15. Good job guys. You're right there. Better at the end, let's push. Copy that. Nice and steady on the way. Sargent stopped, actually, for feeling out well as well. Excellent race, guys. The car was on the rail and that last run.
[2382/6155] STR: So, last heads up. We've had another penalty, so we're currently P11, but we believe other penalties to come, so there's still a chance of a point. Still a chance of a point. No, let's track, we met, honestly. You
[2383/6155] ZHO: I'm exhausted. I'm pushing air like a Koli lapdara. Holy Bolly. Car was great. Thank you. Best of most favorite consist.

Let's keep this up to the end of the season. And we can catch some guys ahead.

[2394/6155] OCO: Okay, so we're going to fire up in just under five minutes. Can you go to exit five please?
[2395/6155] PER: So yeah, we know it's a long race. My UK box should be synced, pit limiter on fire, remember the brakes, and my point find once on the ground. I expect we will spend on that pack of stuff. Fill the temperature through the formation of that nice positiveness one. Enter turn 19, it's lifting coast part, bottle after that, and then throw a pit wall. Two long, one short, two long, one short, but now, should be about 35 seconds of stationary time today.
[2396/6155] VER: Ok, for my shell up, proceed with facts. So, vote 12 for the dummy launch. Pit limiter off. And static 5.5 of once the car is on the ground. Pit limiter off, static 5.5 once cars on the ground. So, if you can, we're looking to target plus 17 plus 17 under the dash for the rear tires. Lift and coast into turn 19 and after turn 19 no more than 50% throttle. In terms of burnouts after the Mercedes Pit War, so that's P22, Mercedes Pit War 2 long, one short burnout, 2 long and one short burnout.

[2402/6155] ALO: and then some weaving just staying on the racing line weaving. Keep it as clean.
[2403/6155] PIA: I'll go contact LooksOK in Data, Confirm all OK.

[2413/6155] RUS: George, we are under investigation for that overtake with Gash tree. We're going to meet you up with Doctor. Yes. He don't drop me up the road. That's a much cleaner exit, I need it. Yeah, copy that.
[2414/6155] SAI: y 0.8 behind, 0.8 behind with the RS, Also check out behind lando with the RS.
[2415/6155] HUL: Think about GIF 23, but it's your choice. We're past the peak on overheating, so if you can watch the traction, it will get better and better.
[2416/6155] GAS: XO salve
[2417/6155] GAS: Okay so cap 2, Russell I have to stay able at 2 seconds, that might be opportunity.
[2418/6155] STR: Great job mate, 10 to go.
[2419/6155] PER: Ok, let us know if you want to more aggressive push toggle, otherwise focus on turn 11. That is the secret of overtaking.
[2420/6155] ALB: If I was to go quicker I would. I'm thinking massively. Yeah, copy that.
[2421/6155] NOR: And then a reminder to drink how the tyres to ask they look hot but stable. Yep, I might need a rear. Awesome bit of front.
[2422/6155] PIA: No further action for our bonn, so we'll have to overtake him on track.
[2423/6155] PIA: So Oscar Russell has a 5 second penalty and Albon is being investigated for overtaking off track planted to play for. Let's keep watching those tyres get temperatures under control.
[2424/6155] MAG: Safety car window is open. Safety car window is open.
[2425/6155] OCO: 
[2426/6155] OCO: Okay, I'm happy to urge you stay to say to warn if there's any more
[2427/6155] NOR: And I'm going to suggest red A4 or red A4. At this point in the race you'll have fastest car on track. Look ahead to the 40.3 last time.
[2428/6155] ALB: So, the sights are picked up at the pace a little bit. Last lap, 41-3, but let's still go after what we can do.
[2429/6155] STR: The car behind Fernando has the arrest. The seat can go. My car is again. A lot of pass. Keep pushing my head down.
[2430/6155] ZHO: 5 will have to go, 4th one is a reference lap time, try to close on the kepper.
[2431/6155] GAS: Next the Rehils, the stuff he don't have a plastic rebels. Copy.
[2432/6155] STR: I'm just keeping it down, do what you can to control, sir. I'm doing it, man, it's shoot! I'm going to take this high for everybody to keep focus. No, I'm not taking this, I'm going to take this high for everybody to keep focus.
[2433/6155] ALO: 好的 Ter вос

[2441/6155] PIA: Like that, that was P10 in the end, I'm afraid. Looks like the Tire's got away from us a bit with the battling at the start. We also picked up a bit of damage, so we'll regroup on that and go again tomorrow.
[2442/6155] PIA: like that that was speed yep and just had no grip at all

[2443/6155] RIC: Okay, a bit of a difficult start on the scenes, but I think we don't quite a lot towards ends, so good food for tomorrow. Yeah, understood. He was learning as it went on. Yeah, quite interesting, so we'll play back. Yep. Let's start with tomorrow.
[2444/6155] NOR: They are good pace, good race, just a bad call us for too long, so it cost me a bit good job.
[2445/6155] LEC: I'll explain you later why I didn't make fans on our side to be slow and touch. Understood?
[2446/6155] SAI: And P6? Yeah, that's one. Hopefully, we'll end this. Bye. Too much landing going on little. Too much landing going on little.
[2447/6155] BOT: Okay, actually you've faced felt decent. Cool, I did the competition so tomorrow it's gonna be good.
[2448/6155] TSU: Let's go with Chao John. Be 14. Who's a good race? Yeah, we keep doing the same tomorrow. How the best at? Could you report the tour that time? How's this keep overtaking from the off track? That should be legal. Yes, you're already done. We are on it.
[2449/6155] ZHO: Posias felveääcaikita 345M Thompson 2 filtering 321M
[2450/6155] RUS: Okay, so it's here in the end with that penalty. Yeah, good race, too, it's quick and on the right areas, it's going to get passed. Yeah, some good learning for tomorrow, though. And encouraging pace.
[2451/6155] ALB: at the gap was 5.3 at the line, sorry mate, we nearly had him. It's a strong race Alex, it bodes well for tomorrow, rather. Yeah, a bit frustrating but one of them. I will de-refeit about the tires for it. Yeah.
[2452/6155] GAS: Yeah that's two points. So we take that. Yeah absolutely, few things to review for tomorrow. I acquired a lot of struggle with the locking and breaking and I acquired a lot of take towards the end so check that out. Yeah, copy.
[2453/6155] SAR: Now we're going to all get learning, foot smile, let's build on that.
[2454/6155] MAG: Thanks, Gev. We clearly haven't found the gold ticket. Anyway, good effort early on and try to stay where you were. Talk later.
[2455/6155] HUL: Okay, checkered flag, Nico, mode, slow. Nico, can you press in button? We need it for a sub-load. We need in button please.
[2456/6155] PER: It's looking pretty gusty out there, particularly on that one through term one.
[2457/6155] ALO: Mae'r ffllaf oes? No, ffllaf. Mae'r ffllaf oes? Mae'r ffllaf oes? Mae'r ffllaf oes?
[2458/6155] RUS: I've lost the button on the back of the brake magic. Copy that, we'll see what we can do on the grid for it.
[2459/6155] PER: My drink is leaking really badly. Copy. I need any well at the time. Okay, understood.
[2460/6155] RUS: And George could you just confirm if the button was there at the start of the run and has fallen off since? Always always been missing.
[2461/6155] STR: My mom is a bit too slow Box believe me aquell a
[2462/6155] TSU: Okay we call the car and we stop on the grid. Call the car, stop on the grid. It's more like a stability side I would say. High speed is good stability. Probably stop more towards the wall. We call it like 14. It starts to get a bit of the same corner, but we can probably adjust the speed as which is the interaction is not the best. So, we have to move on similar one here at least.
[2463/6155] SAR: I can go in, focus on pulling the car, pulling the car one more time for the big land. With a good focus on pulling the car we could do another start, you wear five deep again and try to focus on the drop. Wait, were the only people that cool the car? Don't worry about what everyone else is doing, we're doing it for our plan. Don't worry about everybody else.
[2464/6155] ALB: Just trick the drink system, it's got like some air in it or the juice is fetching or something. It's not a smooth stream of water. Okay, copy that next, we'll have a look.
[2465/6155] VER: OK, formation lap procedures then. Boat 12 for the dummy launch, we do need the pit limiter on today. Pit lane speed limiter on. And it's a static bike from foam once the car is on the ground. And as yesterday, looking for round plus 12 for the rear tyres, plus 12 on the deck. And again, lift the coast into turn 19 and after turn 19, no more than 50% throttle. Today's burnout start from just before the Ferrari pit war. It's a same procedure as yesterday, so two long, one short, two long and one short burnout. And the extra ramp if you have the tire that's based to do so well, it goes it down into your style position.
[2466/6155] OCO: So everything in terms of balance is as we talked about. I think let's see how we get on with that tailwind into 19. We've got the Model 5 for there as we talked about the Stuart, so that's all good. No change to any of the procedures on the formation map. So I think we'll just be pinning through all ones to cast fire up for this model.
[2467/6155] NOR: Look at the landing time and fill. Everybody starts medium except for a whole campurgan straw in the pit lane. They've got hard ones.
[2468/6155] GAS: You were on target on the second start on lap to the grid. During the formation lap, let's repeat what you did yesterday. It was very good for the contires and bringing them up to temperature. Watch out with over-slip and raise the rope. In terms of burnouts, so reach out to people before the burnouts. You would like to do two longer burnouts coming out of the last corner. So two longer burnouts coming out of the last corner. And the static pipe won't run before the start.
[2469/6155] PIA: I'll score launch feedback. You were 1% shallow 1% shallow.
[2470/6155] GAS: I'm just wishing you all, so I'd bless you, all behind you. Thanks, champ.
[2471/6155] ALB: Happy to push 11-12.
[2472/6155] RIC: Ok good job on the brakes, back to offset 1. I keep you posted on Taiwaning.
[2473/6155] HUL: Where is the first car now? First car is approaching the grid. Last car is sergeant is at hit entry.
[2474/6155] SAR: No, rot I want to end it think white and two
[2475/6155] NOR: Reminder, bottom toggle for low speed baseline might be red a6 red a6
[2476/6155] OCO: Okay, let's go ump up. If I speed things got damaged left hand side pod about 40 points of load at the moment
[2477/6155] RUS: point for ahead a climb behind the DRS disc lap
[2478/6155] NOR: Okay, no, DRS has been enabled. LeClerc is 2.2 behind. Then, Syntz, Hamilton, the Steppen and Oskis 6.7. Then, is Russell 10.
[2479/6155] GAS: Das hat ein kleines CHANGE und ... loose time.
[2480/6155] OCO: Okay, here is the car behind us, let me through please.
[2481/6155] MAG: You are 0.8 from Botas Sergeant 0.5 behind. Just be careful with rear sliding at turn 6 appreciate it was a traffic.
[2482/6155] SAI: Let me turn point 4 behind with the RS.4 The stupid. Yeah, name is max 1.2
[2483/6155] PER: So that is the biggest one, let's see. It's ready. Do you want to step on the death? Yep.
[2484/6155] TSU: 正腹を責していると意識してる
[2485/6155] VER: Any more of them, please. Please. So you're looking for four or less run to high speed, perhaps? I said more of them. I'm sorry.
[2486/6155] GAS: Okay, let's see what state is at a moment. One, two, three. Happy.
[2487/6155] PER: esa운끈 das find ich auch nicht
[2488/6155] SAI: We are sliding a bit to the left in 16. I don't feel it, but I'm trying to give you a rest. I'm just saying more. Good.
[2489/6155] RIC: update on tires on plan A versus plan B when you come. Yeah, it's a pretty stable at the moment.
[2490/6155] TSU: 시면 stopsicوب orteszra
[2491/6155] MAG: Start the struggle on the tyres now.
[2492/6155] PIA: Oscar, recharge on and no full pedal we need big lifts. I'm afraid we've got to retire the car.
[2493/6155] STR: Cadillan's Piazzt Street ahead is slow, is retiring, is in turn 14.
[2494/6155] ALO: He went off track. Just watch past me here and pass you slow. Copy understood. Understood. The end 10-12. I need a position. Quick please. Copy understood. Understood. We're on it. We're on it. In its five seconds you vehicle to the mid lane. Copy understood. I know we lost two seconds fighting. We lost track. I know he goes to the pit. Copy. We're on it. Copy that.

[2569/6155] PER: 40.6 for signs, gap 3.1, 14 laps to go.
[2570/6155] ALO: Okay, so we got 13 laps ago, and this one's 1.2 head on 8 lap older mediums
[2571/6155] HAM: So you're pulling them in, you're pulling them in. So forecast P2 may be the win.
[2572/6155] LEC: What do you think about Plan C or keep Plan D? What the Plan C is reading my race? No, but I try. It's too late.
[2573/6155] STR: You can ask 610 quick on the Sonoda, half a second quick on the Gasly. Trust that we don't do everything to maximize your race, just focus on the pace, it's good.
[2574/6155] BOT: Okay, Valti, we're gired out now on 9 seconds ahead, and you're closing at 1 second of the lap. A sergeant's six ahead is on a black and white for track limits.
[2575/6155] VER: Safe Paces Hamilton. Please no talking and in the braking. Honours the votes.
[2576/6155] HAM: He's as quick as you're on the hard. You're still chipping away mate, you're still chipping away.
[2577/6155] NOR: Now we take the best rate to get the pack up, his red button turn 3, 10, 4.
[2578/6155] STR: Fair in late, please, ma'am.
[2579/6155] TSU: That also is so dangerous, the debris coming out a lot.
[2580/6155] ALO: We can't send anything yet, we can't send anything.
[2581/6155] HAM: I swear at Lewis, we've got the staff and he is 5 seconds ahead, he is managing a brake issue, don't you?
[2582/6155] STR: So, as long as you're P9, P9, that's ghastly five in front. So there's seven laps to go into this lap. Can we get him? If you keep the pace up, there's a chance.
[2583/6155] ALB: Oh, it just happened there in the corner. Okay, we're checking.
[2584/6155] LEC: And let's sign by do not lose time.
[2585/6155] LEC: Why do I have to let's hear the signs but let's take us to the right.
[2586/6155] SAI: I see Norris is low, no? Yeah, one second is lower than us. Push. Let's go. Let's go.
[2587/6155] SAI: You think you can do it? Let's go!
[2588/6155] ALB: Yeah and now we've had a track limit to turn 19 last lap. Okay so we need to create a gap to Hulkenberg. Yeah okay okay. What's the face difference? Alex we're lacking four tenths quicker than Hulkenberg so we're all good. Gap seven seconds and he's fighting with Logan as well so that's slowing him down.
[2589/6155] ALB: I've got quite a lot of vibration on the left, I've got a rear tires. Okay, copy that we're having a look.
[2590/6155] STR: How many violence? Three to go when you cross the line. Three to go when you cross the line. Let's go to them. Yeah, let's do it. Come on man.
[2591/6155] VER: 3.6 No talking and the breaking that
[2592/6155] NOR: Come out, let's P3, P3. Hey, hey, that was a tough one. Better not approach him. What a boys and girls, what a good one. Good load of points. Thank you very much. Good weekend. Yeah, good ass it mate.
[2593/6155] VER: Well done. Do it in the celebrations. I'll see you Friday. Well done. Tough raisment, still one. That's good. Well done mate. That's win number 50 for you and quite a few in a row in US now. So we're very well managed with the issues you had. Well done. Yeah, exactly. Good win still. Great job.
[2594/6155] HAM: Nice work Lewis. So that's P2 mate. That was an amazing drive. We just needed a couple of all laps. Fantastic weekend guys. Really well done. We've got work to do in lots of different areas but let's keep pushing. Thank you to the roadback of the factory for the upgrade. Let's keep pushing. We're getting closer. Next time. I really appreciate you not giving up on us. It's now I never give up mate. Never give up. That's a solid drive.
[2595/6155] NOR: I thought it's a tough one. Better not a podium.
[2596/6155] HAM: Lo is really done. We could have done a few things better, but your driving was great and nice to see that we did a real fast. The pace of the car was there, to win it, your driving was amazing. Congratulations.
[2597/6155] PER: Okay, P5, DC recovery. Science is lucky. We almost had him. We have two chances to run the goth here.
[2598/6155] LEC: I'm not really thinking how to maximize everything. You did a good job managing the tires. Yeah, I agree. Does a boxer want to have a s*** result?
[2599/6155] TSU: Check if like yes we got it good job charge on so P10 and fastest lap Yeah good job guys we got lucky day but what a simple good race yeah you are right but yeah we need to be happy about the race Yeah we need to have very much I mean we have very much not enough
[2600/6155] SAI: Yeah, that was a strong race and a surprise to be close to the modlar and the good job. My mods locked...
[2601/6155] RUS: What a trade race, so slow on those hards. Did nine just now, what was going on there? Yeah, eight from. And we'll go stroke him. I'll pay to the M, stroke one. I'll pay to the M, was very strong there on that medium. We were the fastest out there.
[2602/6155] BOT: I think our patients that brought today at the end also with the defending against the fresh tire was impossible but they had ultimately patients quite there.
[2603/6155] ZHO: Yeah, we didn't really have the price.
[2604/6155] GAS: I think we definitely made the best out of the weekend. I think it was a very clean and very good last weekend. So I'm pleased we finished on the... On the strong weekend it's some good, good couple of points. So thanks, Carol. There's a player there. And, yeah.
[2605/6155] STR: So take the pick up one more lap, put it out of him. Yeah, it was excellent, my excellent work.
[2606/6155] ALB: Okay, that's a checkered flag, checkered flag. So P11, blue, three, position one, blue, three, position one. Woke me in, we've boxed too early on the first, first in. I was surprised how bad the hard was, but I think everyone was right on the hard snow. Yeah, our pace was pretty good on that hard, but yeah, we'll have a look and review after the race. It feels a good job for me, or side? Yeah, but our pace was relatively good, or it was actually good on the hards. Probably we would just clear out traffic on the hard tire and then we'd destroyed the tires. I don't really know if you guys expected me to overtake Joe in that stint, but I was just, I was like a killer stint. Yeah, so on that hard, it pace was a bit worse than yesterday, but compared to others, it was competitive. So we will review it all, see what we can prove next time. And when you can, the should be the last one, blue, ten, position 13, please, blue, ten, thirteen.
[2607/6155] MAG: Okay, Kev, that's the checkered flag. That's the checkered flag, so that's over. For reference, you finished P16, Ricardo behind Dupes 17, Alonzo Piestri and Ocob all retired.
[2608/6155] NOR: What are boys and girls going on? Good load of points. Thank you very much. Good weekend. Yep. Good afternoon. And Lando, a drive of the day as well. Thanks. Thanks fans. Basically a win then really.
[2609/6155] HUL: Ok, Niko, you finished P13, you were within 10 seconds of Albon, so he should have a penalty, so that will be P12. Sonoto was P10, he was like 10 seconds up the road, but he did an extra stop to get fast to slap the end.
[2610/6155] SAR: Okay check a flag, check a flag, pick a rub, pick a rub, E12, E12, Alex in kind of UT11. There's a 5 second penalty, I guess under investigation, that's strong race, strong race mate. That's why we've been talking about building up the weekend and building up for that Sunday. That was a strong Sunday, good job, good job. Thank you guys, yesterday I was poor but today was a good day. Thank you, I'm giving you my all. Oh Logan, good job. Got a bit of lucky in that T1 but I'll wait a fight back, good job guys. Sorry for the pit stops, really bad positioning by me but, yeah. Sorry. We look, we take it. That's a good one. Take it. Enjoy.
[2611/6155] VER: 
[2612/6155] RUS: Just show that big D-rate into 4, same as yesterday.

[2833/6155] VER: I think you managed that well, Max. I looked after the tyres in the right places, the right time. Obviously still have plenty to go. 14-7 on the last lap is very strong. Let's say Norris gave up the Ghost, Czecho 15-5 last lap, Russell 16-9. That was their pace at the end, Leclerc 16-5. Yeah, that was much stronger now. Thankfully, yep.

[2840/6155] NOR: Yeah good job good comms and everything so cheers. I'll do that. Just need to be a bit quicker. Let's look at it.
[2841/6155] RUS: That's P4. Good job at the start there. Nice overtaking, some nice moves. It's a shame it dropped away from us. Yeah, well I don't think we did a week at then.

[2917/6155] SAI: So nothing strange on the gear box, all fine, we are checking anyway, there is anything else. No, it's what I had before, it's sticky, but it's here. Copy, must be staying with.
[2918/6155] ALO: Okay, push and hold, push and hold your loads of energy, hold it down.
[2919/6155] VER: What a max. Fantastic job. Yes, again, mate. What a max. That was absolutely clinical once again. Well done. Another Brazilian victory. Thanks, guys. That was a very good performance. Very nice. Well executed. Good pit stops.
[2920/6155] ALO: Yes! That is a hello. Go to Cool and Ronsonch. Cool. Nice to slow on the way and load a pickup. Unbelievable. Yeah, copy guys. This is for you guys. This is for you. For all of you guys, all the factory, everyone. Everyone. This is for you. Thank you very much. Well done, my well impressed.
[2921/6155] NOR: Ok mate, B2, B2, almost! Very race mate, fantastic drive, fastest lap, fastest lap. Yeah, good job everyone, amazing. Good weekend, better start today, great pace so weekend. Yeah, amazing, kinda getting a little better, just always from car in the way. But very happy, modern everyone.
[2922/6155] PER: Check out that was a big drive, unfortunately just missed out there mate. Yeah. Yeah. Then I'd like to say we should have followed Louisette on the first dip. Yeah, but anyway, good points. He just picked one hell of a fight. Yeah, that was a strong drive checker, so so unlucky on that last lap, but you gave it everything. And good points versus, you know, for the P2. Exactly. Well done. Well done, right. Little expensive with Bernie though. I mean, it couldn't have been closer. It was no point nor nor nor, but there you go. Haha, there you go. Oh, exactly. Anyway, this way it is.
[2923/6155] GAS: I had this dust on my eye like I've been crying the last 20 laps driving one with one high, not the easiest. Not bad for one either. Then someone will get you some drops. If you see me crying is not because I'm emotional for PCIe then. I'll just... Alright, alright. I won't tell you. Good step guys. Good job. Two more to go. Try to do better next time in Vegas. Two more to go. Thank you mate.
[2924/6155] SAR: Yeah, sorry man, obviously we didn't have the pace today. I gave you everything I had, just not easy. Sorry about not being able to fight to no to harder.
[2925/6155] TSU: Sorry guys, my mistake. That's okay, you can still a good progress from B16, so we should be happy.
[2926/6155] RIC: I think you should be pleased where we are and we've got good rescues coming. A lot to look forward to the pass with the lockers and tweezers.
[2927/6155] STR: Lance at P5, P5, Fernando P3 got checker back last lap, P3, P5 for the team, fantastic.
[2928/6155] HUL: Really good drive, Nico, pace and management, excellent. I can do the perfect job on the tires for our car. Yup, thank you.
[2929/6155] HAM: Well I know it's mate, that's P8. Hard of work P8's but yeah well done mate. Yeah, thanks for the hat. That was a long slow and tough time after that. Yeah, copy, same here mate. But yeah got lost to look at and yeah, get it sorted for the next two. Lois, horrible for all of us. Car can't go back like this when we were in the studio. We need to find out what went wrong. But yeah, thank you for surviving that. No, no, next week I'll talk. But I don't say that loud stuff, you know. No, it's not the result we wanted but still did a really great job through the weekend to get some thanks. Yeah, it's loose, yeah, much appreciated.
[2930/6155] PIA: Sorry about that, Oscar for a straiting day. Unfortunately that was set in turn one lap on with nothing else, one lap. Ricardo fed similarly. So we finished P14 with retirement behind us. Yeah, so before I begin but thank you very much. Everyone who fixed the car was a very, very impressive effort. So thank you. Still went a lot from getting the laps in today. So thank you very much for everyone who helped fix it. Thank you. Yeah, great Oscar fantastic job getting the car back out.
[2931/6155] OCO: OK, and that is Peter. So in the end we were the only car that finished that did a three-stop. Everyone asked it too. Yeah, Copic, there was no one trying, the vehicle was super high so... Yeah, absolutely right, it was worth a go. A bit of luck slightly differently and it could have been a very different story. So well done for sticking with it. Still, from Pete 14, I'll take a point.
[2932/6155] MAG: Okay, Kevin, would you like a front wing adjustment? Err... no, I don't want to see obvious direction. Okay, copy that. So try through the pit lane slowly to do another start, please.
[2933/6155] STR: When there's 19 kph gusts, we'll get the tyres changed and then you will fire the car up on Harry's signal.
[2934/6155] HUL: So we see like a tailwind going into 12 and into 14 and then variable wind as you go through 14, 15, 16.
[2935/6155] SAR: Okay you go in, put the car, find some potential tree. There was magic of 20mins on potential breaking points. The draft will do another start and you will wear 6, 6, 6, tip. I'm barely dropping it.
[2936/6155] HAM: He covers guys, covers.
[2937/6155] GAS: And we can go recharge on and we're going to the grid It is not needed from our side
[2938/6155] OCO: So it's back coming from the front wing, the straight. I'm not sure if it's okay. Okay, understood, we'll have a look.
[2939/6155] PIA: Oscar, we're going to the grid this lap. How is the tire grip? Copy. Which all don't tire grip? The tire grip is okay. Not amazing, but not terribly though. Copy that.
[2940/6155] RUS: I just need to make my drink tube short with all the force in my whole hands going right on my throat. Yeah, I can put that well. I have a look on the grid. Fuel is a point force angle.
[2941/6155] ALO: Fanando for Mikey, can you hear me? Yes. Copy that. Copy just the right edge. Yeah, that's clear. Yeah, it's all good for me as well.
[2942/6155] BOT: Okay, about 3, so track temp is still at 19 degrees and wind looks to still be the same as on on the screen.
[2943/6155] GAS: and everything is a bit cold right now so we need to hold pre-start revs a little bit longer yeah just for the boys if you can really keep the covers when we put the covers the blankets blankets off here yeah we can do that so we need to recharge on and pit lane speedometer off now but once the engine is fired up we'll go pit lane speedometer on we'll do the bike point learn and then hold pre-start revs a little bit longer and then we can do the start for scenario one sock six and then energy usage on the start is high so we need to try and avoid overtake on the first lap copy we're in a good spot mate so let's just focus on having a clean race and we know something can happen around here let's just stay focused and see what we can get yeah it's gonna be fun let's be on it always and for days a plate result waiting for us yeah copy that
[2944/6155] MAG: Okay, Keith. All cars around us are on UC3, apart from Hamilton directly behind, who's on a used... Sorry, everyone around us is on UC4, apart from Hamilton, behind us on used, UC3. Then new C4s all the way back to the last row when they're on... Joe's on the PS3 on hard, and the last two cars are on soft.
[2945/6155] ALO: Make a little gap and then you can lean on the tyres as best you can through there and some high speed weaving down to 5.
[2946/6155] ALB: Try to do brake warming into fire, it will help. It gets down everything. Try to do some brake warming again. Push and hold the button, push and hold the button. Brake warming, then we can accelerate.
[2947/6155] OCO: Okay, it's much weaving as you can, let's focus on more on the front.
[2948/6155] RUS: So we have five burnouts at the end of the yellow lines turns. Are you sure us enough? The fire is filled to the coke. Happy with five? So yeah, we'll do five burnouts. The final burnout will be at P8 Magnussen.
[2949/6155] VER: Max, I think we're happy you were ahead when you were top-trots. Happy Slater. Oh, boss, I was out.

[2950/6155] BOT: Yeah, he's just spawning in front of me or someone. He'd be out the back. Fuck yeah. Okay, you can firm here from the back as well. Question? Yes. Okay, copy. So far, Ty's okay. You're struggling to assess the front wing. Can you feel something? Hard to say yet. It's so low-curve. Copy. Copy.
[2951/6155] HAM: That's the only place that's been I've got here. Yeah, copy, it's all shuffled a bit.
[2952/6155] LEC: This needs to be addressed now. It is a joke, he thinks of the position. He wasn't in front of the apex and he pushed me wide. So he needs to give that position back.
[2953/6155] SAI: I think it will make it all in a happy future. It was in Bonsi, when we took our truck for a meal. Stop it.
[2954/6155] GAS: Safety cars stay out, safety car recharge on, we're staying out.
[2955/6155] GAS: So we've got Norris off at turn 12. It's gonna be like that, they're all raised so... It's gonna be a long evening but let's try to make them a side. Yep, we'll stay on top of it. Just keep an eye on your delta and then work the tires.
[2956/6155] HAM: Okay, copy. We'll have a look.
[2957/6155] LEC: So Charles, the case is with the stevers and we stay where we are in terms of positioning. Okay? At the moment it's like this. If anything changes, I will let you know.
[2958/6155] BOT: Okay, I'll suggest high steering inputs to warm up those fronts and weaving on the back straight when you get them.
[2959/6155] STR: So we're P15 at the moment, show ahead on the hard per is behind. We'll saw the hard sides behind him and then Fernando behind him. Fernando spun to one and then I'm going to split it to hard under the VSC. So you know the plan from here, just maintain these tie-tips. It will be low grip on the restart.
[2960/6155] HUL: So right now your P9, Sonota behind in P10 still has his race start soft and then behind him everyone else is on a hard with exception of Ricardo still on this medium.
[2961/6155] RUS: So tire temps now are dropping blue where the blankets would normally sit so these are very very little tires. Yeah mate I know. I know. Like when you're waiting at the moment. I know.

It's just seven seconds ago, not the road for struggling as well. And it seems to be coming a bit back at the very end. What a problem was I just had to defend every lap and it was just killing me and I couldn't say good laps. Yeah. Okay, overall, I think we take a lot of positive from this weekend, mate. So this quality wanted to nail, we did that this weekend, that's ticked. And this was a tough one, but it's kind of thing we need to learn as well to do and to manage. So we review what we could have done differently, but we did it, brought the car home. So that's good. Jump on me, okay? Back to back, mate. Pick up, probably, please. Oh no, I'm going to say the best we had with the car we had out there today. We still have a lot more to go, still seven for the championship, so let's keep fighting for it. Yep, we will. Everyone start.

[3074/6155] PER: Oh, fuck, I was an expert to him. We were so stolen, three bit. Well, I check out that's a great podium and that gives you Peter in the championship. Now you drive a great race from the back of the grid. We'll let some guys just go in the three bit. Hey, Peter in the championship, buddy. That's more important too. Yeah, he's been a hard tough you, but in the end. Yeah, I think we'll grow up a lot after this season. Well done. Well done to the whole team. You're an incredible leader. Nice to get that one to win the championship. Yeah, well done, mate.
[3075/6155] ALB: Ok, be tough, not easy but nice job, well done. Yeah, sorry the radio survived. The green tea, I've won the last three laps. A bit late but yeah. Yeah, coming here, last lap was your quickest. And it's the best we could do with the car we had, well done. So we've got one more round to keep fighting for our position. Yeah, yeah. Everybody was chasing but so. You will turn up senoi.
[3076/6155] PER: Yeah, you really did a good job there, Czecho. I mean, coming from the back of the grid, without downforce level as well, was really, really super drive. So second in the championship, well done. Thanks to all the whole team. Thanks for the run. Yeah, let's get better guys. Good gear. You'll be taken for a nice little try round the track again.
[3077/6155] RIC: Okay, sorry, it's been a tough weekend for us. Sorry for that. We'll learn from that. On the very clear warm-up tire issue, other safety car restarts. We'll look into it. Yep, you understood. Yeah, I think it was all pretty clear where we struggled. We're trying to understand that. Sorry, we couldn't do it. We couldn't really do much more. Okay, so we finished P14. So actually Williams didn't score on our direct competitors didn't score. And you can retire to love to go with an issue on the car. I don't know why, but we have a yellow intern 17 before the P10 tree. So keep your eyes open. Not sure what's going on there. Okay, understood. On the let's make sure once we get to the yellow section we don't have a take anyone please. Okay, then when you stop the car is P1 then wait for the dash on the P0. So obviously a very hard weekend with performance on the bad thing up there. But I think we keep making good progress on our side. With comes on the set up on things so we're getting done. Yep, understood. All right, yeah, we'll debrief back back inside. I think it's all clear. As you mentioned the restarts. It was honestly so hard. Yeah, super clear. And then the first this as we believe that's why we triggered some issues afterwards on the medium.
[3078/6155] SAI: And we are P4 in the driver's championship. Okay. And four points behind Mercedes. Good. It will be a nice last race. Good job Carlos. Was a good one. Thank you Fred. Who was that? Nacey out there today. Oh no. Big mess. Oh no.

It could be something on the tracks, so just keep an eye. Exit of 16 through 17. So ahead of you is just Ocon, Perez, Leclerc, the staff and the race winner. Behind you, Scynts, Hamilton, Russell, Fernando, Piazri. Piazri got faster slap, so we've taken 10 points from McLaren today. So that's an excellent day's work, well done.

Yeah, we'll quite a lot of work to look at. A lot of things to look at. But, uh, yeah, good quality. Just need to understand that race. So, straighting it to the end. We'll work, we'll work.

[3086/6155] PIA: OK, I skid that was P10 and fast-disk lap. A shame what happened there with the puncture. Pace was looking really strong, but we take the points that were on the board. Unfortunately it was only the point for P10 and fast-disk lap, but pace was good, so nice recovery after qualifying. Yeah, I felt like we deserved a little more from that, but thank you everyone. It's a difficult weekend, but take a couple of points. First lap's cool, so thank you. And definitely some positives out of that race, so thank you very much.

[3139/6155] ALB: Okay, check a flag P14. Well, Alex, your hard work this year is what brought us seventh in the Constructors' Championship. It's a power moment you can set up tall as a result of that and look back on yourself and be incredibly proud of what you've achieved. Thank you for your hard work on season. I'm sorry we didn't have the card of each of these days to finish it in style. No, thank you. Thanks, James. Thank you everyone. It was a hard fought season. I think we didn't know anything about it. Everyone should be very proud of themselves. I feel like this is just a style. This is just a style to win the good things. So, yeah, enjoy the rest. I know I will. Thank you everyone. This is me and I get to do donuts. Absolutely not. Well done, mate.
[3140/6155] ALO: Well done, piece 7, I'll have a last interview. Yes, well done guys, we've got an incredible season. We had so many guys enjoy, had a good break, we come back stronger next year. But yeah, 12 months ago we were probably the only dream about being in this position. So congratulations everyone. Yep, and to you mate, that's well done. We've got you as P400 championship drivers, well done. So we finished level on points with LeClair but we think camp back wise you've been in them. You had more P3 ponies. Okay, well done guys. I'm happy with the race and super happy and proud of you for this season. So we come back stronger next year. We're going to be easier, we don't need to do the 6 feet and so much, how much days into it? First few months, it should be a little bit better. Yeah, exactly, well done mate. So I guess I'm not allowed to do any burnout. Negative, mate. Actually I did one in Las Vegas, I'm going to see nothing. That's enough.
[3141/6155] BOT: Thank you for today, this weekend and the whole season. I know it's been a very tough year, but thank you for continuing to push, continuing to believe in us. And we'll work hard every winter to bring you something better next year. Yeah, thank you, tough season for everyone. Lots of work to do, but thanks for the efforts and just make a better call for next year. And yes, thank you, thank you. It was a pleasure.
[3142/6155] HUL: 2023 is complete now so we'll be on to more for next year. Very good drive though. Yeah, yeah thanks. Yeah, just not the pace I guess. The downforce but go get next year. Hopefully we'll buy the tools. Thanks for this year. For all this work this year guys. Look forward for more. Yeah, copy that Niko. Good job, it's been fun. Ciao for now.
[3143/6155] TSU:

[3145/6155] PER: Now let me now let your clutch guys avoid falling forwards
[3146/6155] MAG: I had to move my microphone. It was a bit out of place so I think that's a good mic to be better now. Yes much better.

[3148/6155] RUS: 然後上まで開始
[3149/6155] TSU: The balance of fire is pretty little bit understated in the high speed, but I think it's good. Most of the players are also actually little fun rotations in slow speed, so it's not that bad place to...
[3150/6155] RUS: Thanks, Sliden. 12. Cool. This is hard.
[3151/6155] NOR: I'm happy to do a launch no banner. Well, it's too late now isn't it? I'm sorry. Sorry.
[3152/6155] RUS: I'll have a stick with this green 9 setup.
[3153/6155] SAR: But that's yourがだったのか, but be manual pianist!
[3154/6155] SAR: You know how to manage this? Very good thinking, P2. Good management. Always careful for everything. I would have a good life, okay?
[3155/6155] RIC: The wind is obviously changed direction a lot from yesterday, so just let me know if that changes through the race.
[3156/6155] GAS: Who knows what can happen. We'll race hard, race clean, all cars are on the saw. Let's see what we can do out there.
[3157/6155] ZHO: דроб וה shovel
[3158/6155] GAS: Okay, here front wing looks okay from our side.
[3159/6155] OCO: Back surface slippery term fork of a debris cast behind Pierre then butters.
[3160/6155] HUL: Okay Nico, we'll just go as long as we can on this one and see what we can make of the race. So give us a good introduction here.
[3161/6155] RUS: Green 3 position hall urgent.
[3162/6155] PIA: Okay, I'll scoot now as our chance. Let's follow and prove.
[3163/6155] NOR: I just struggling with the rear. I have no rear.
